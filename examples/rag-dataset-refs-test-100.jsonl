Hear him: \u2018it is regrettable that African countries spend between $30 billion and $50billion annually on imports of agricultural products, instead of developing the productive capacities necessary for trade\u2019.\nAccording to the United Nations\u2019 2015 World Population Prospect Report, 2.4 billion people are projected to be added to the global population between 2015 and 2050, with 1.3 billion in Africa alone. Which means by 2050, Africa will house more than half of the world\u2019s population and as at now no preparation is being made on how it will feed its 1.3 billion population by 2050. What about the now? 2050 is still some years ahead; what are the African leaders doing to stop, or at least, reduce the importation of finished agricultural products. Currently, Africa is still unable to feed itself and depends on importation of products to feed its people. What will happen by 2050, if a stop is not put to this trend?\nThe potential for growth in Sustainable Agriculture in Africa is well understood, but has not been realised. Currently, the agro-allied industry (in primary processing) accounts for nearly half of all economic the activity in sub-Saharan Africa. At the same time, the continent spends $30bn to $50bn each year importing food and still has significant food risk and nutritional deficiencies in many parts of the region. This is despite the fact that the continent holds much of the world\u2019s potential agricultural land (Africa has 65% of the world arable land).\nAccording to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (UN FAO), Africa spends $35 billion in importing food, and it is projected that the number will grow to $110 billion by 2025. Africa is importing what it should be producing, creating poverty within the region and consequently creating jobs for the people in other continents while its people lack opportunities.\nIt is interesting to note that African countries import numerous agricultural products which are also, ironically, produced locally. The rise of imports for these Agricultural products has been attributed to the inability to produce enough to satisfy growing local demand, due to low yields and relatively low levels of productivity. Furthermore, over 80% of Africa\u2019s agricultural products are being produced by smallholder farmers who produce 70% of the continent\u2019s food supply, according to FAO.\nTaking a look at Agricultural exports, one discovers that African countries mainly export cocoa, edible fruit and nuts, coffee and tea and vegetables to the rest of the world. The main agricultural importing countries of the African export are the United States, China, Germany, Netherlands and the United Kingdom.\nAfrican countries do not feature under the top supplying countries for any of these markets. If Africa is serious about changing from agricultural product importers, then addressing the following issues are of paramount importance: innovation in production technology, the cost of inputs (energy and fertilisers), management of changes in climatic conditions (e.g. access to water through irrigation), knowledge transfer and capacity building, investment in agriculture and agriculture-related infrastructure (credit facilities, transportation networks, cold-storage facilities and communication networks) and access to information.\nALSO READ: Questions on Nigeria\u2019s 2017 Budget\nGovernments and leaders in Africa (past and present) should (have) know(n) in importing food is a serious minus for the leadership of the component countries in Africa.\nAgriculture is also a major component for Africa becoming an industrialised continent, in the sense that its raw materials are needed in production of other commodities.

{"context":"CHI 2010 Workshop May 7 or 8, 2011 (final date to be announced)\nCall for Participation\nLarge interactive displays are now common in public urban life. Museums, libraries, public plazas, and architectural facades already take advantage of interactive technologies for visual and interactive information presentation. Researchers and practitioners from such varied disciplines as art, architecture, design, HCI, and media theory have started to explore the potential and impact of large display installations in public urban settings.\nThis workshop aims to provide a platform for researchers and practitioners from different disciplines such as art, architecture, design, HCI, social sciences, and media theory to exchange insights on current research questions in the area. The workshop will focus on to the following topics: how to design large interactive display installations that promote engaging experiences and go beyond playful interaction, how different interaction models shape people\u2019s experience in urban spaces, and how to evaluate their impact.\nWorkshop Goals & Topics\nThe goal of this one-day CHI 2011 workshop is to cross-fertilize insights from different disciplines, to establish a more general understanding of large interactive displays in public urban contexts, and to develop an agenda for future research directions in this area. Rather than focusing on paper presentations, this workshop aims to trigger active and dynamic group discussions around the following topics:\nBeyond Playful Interaction\nA number of studies found that large display installations invite for playful interaction but often fail to convey meaningful experiences related to content. This raises the following questions:\n- How can we design installations that endure people\u2019s attention past the initial novelty effect and direct the interest toward the content?\n- What design strategies can be applied to promote an active individual and social exploration and discussion of the presented information?\nA number of interaction techniques have been explored for large displays in public spaces ranging from interaction via cell phones, to direct-touch or full body interaction. We would like to discuss:\n- How do different interaction methods shape people\u2019s experience of large display installations in urban spaces?\n- How do interaction methods differ from each other in terms of triggering interaction and engagement with the presented content?\nDifferent quantitative and qualitative methods have been applied to evaluate people\u2019s experience and use of large display installations in public spaces. During the workshop we would like to discuss:\n- How can we evaluate the \"success\" of large display installations in urban spaces?\n- How can particular aspects of public large display installations such as engagement be evaluated?\n- What kind of evaluation methods are most effective in different progress stages (design phase\/installment phase)?\nFor more details on the workshop please refer to our extended abstract and workshop proposal.\nSubmission Details\nSubmit a position paper (maximum 4 pages) to largedisplaysinurbanlife@gmail.com by January 14, 2011 using the CHI extended abstract format.

Museums, libraries, public plazas, and architectural facades already take advantage of interactive technologies for visual and interactive information presentation. Researchers and practitioners from such varied disciplines as art, architecture, design, HCI, and media theory have started to explore the potential and impact of large display installations in public urban settings.\nThis workshop aims to provide a platform for researchers and practitioners from different disciplines such as art, architecture, design, HCI, social sciences, and media theory to exchange insights on current research questions in the area. The workshop will focus on to the following topics: how to design large interactive display installations that promote engaging experiences and go beyond playful interaction, how different interaction models shape people\u2019s experience in urban spaces, and how to evaluate their impact.\nWorkshop Goals & Topics\nThe goal of this one-day CHI 2011 workshop is to cross-fertilize insights from different disciplines, to establish a more general understanding of large interactive displays in public urban contexts, and to develop an agenda for future research directions in this area. Rather than focusing on paper presentations, this workshop aims to trigger active and dynamic group discussions around the following topics:\nBeyond Playful Interaction\nA number of studies found that large display installations invite for playful interaction but often fail to convey meaningful experiences related to content. This raises the following questions:\n- How can we design installations that endure people\u2019s attention past the initial novelty effect and direct the interest toward the content?\n- What design strategies can be applied to promote an active individual and social exploration and discussion of the presented information?\nA number of interaction techniques have been explored for large displays in public spaces ranging from interaction via cell phones, to direct-touch or full body interaction. We would like to discuss:\n- How do different interaction methods shape people\u2019s experience of large display installations in urban spaces?\n- How do interaction methods differ from each other in terms of triggering interaction and engagement with the presented content?\nDifferent quantitative and qualitative methods have been applied to evaluate people\u2019s experience and use of large display installations in public spaces. During the workshop we would like to discuss:\n- How can we evaluate the \"success\" of large display installations in urban spaces?\n- How can particular aspects of public large display installations such as engagement be evaluated?\n- What kind of evaluation methods are most effective in different progress stages (design phase\/installment phase)?\nFor more details on the workshop please refer to our extended abstract and workshop proposal.\nSubmission Details\nSubmit a position paper (maximum 4 pages) to largedisplaysinurbanlife@gmail.com by January 14, 2011 using the CHI extended abstract format. The paper should describe experiences, works in progress, or theories around designing and\/or evaluating large interactive displays in public urban settings.

At a time when the Billboard charts were dominated by squeaky-clean pop acts like 'N Sync and Backstreet Boys, Eminem offered a rebuttal to the hypocritical American mainstream that criticizes rap music while celebrating\u2014and, worse, commercializing\u2014sex, violence, and bigotry in other arenas. This album turned Eminem into a global icon. There was a huge amount of hype and controversy around it\u2014culminating when he performed \"Stan\" at the 2001 Grammys alongside Elton John.

The rage was magnetic, hypnotic. \"Blood, guts, guns, cuts, knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts!\"!!\"\nThe anger spews in every direction as he takes reckless shots at pop culture's other famous figures.

There's still one word out there that even Eminem won't say.\nDespite the album's artistry and massive success, in a weird way, it's hard to call it an \"influential\" album.

{"context":"Most of us have had moments when we think we are fairly unique; the main character of life\u2019s story if you will. I was having one of these moments on Friday night when I approached the TIFF Bell Lightbox in Toronto for a screening of Hitchcock\u2019s classic Dial M for Murder. Surely I would be one of only a handful of cinephiles out on Friday night to catch a movie that is over 50 years old. This attitude was largely responsible for the shock I experienced when I had to scramble to find a seat. The screening must of have been sold out! Perhaps more surprising to me was the variety of people in the audience. Couples were on dates, a mother and her two teenage daughters laughed and gabbed as they found some front row seats, small packs of university students congregated at the back, and an elderly woman asked me to save her a seat in case her expedition towards the centre of the row proved fruitless. The audience was devoid of pretension and snobbery, these people were here to be entertained, and I realized, as I shed my own pretensions, so was I.\nI should mention that the TIFF Bell Lightbox is an amazing movie theatre. The seats are spacious and comfortable, while the cup-holders are ingenious, as they are in front of and below the armrest and completely out of the way, while still easily accessible. Also, the four screenings that I have seen have started promptly, without commercials or previews; kind of a nice change of pace considering that previews are easily accessible online these days.\nDial M for Murder went off without a Hitch, if you don\u2019t count its director. Grace Kelly was still beautiful as the delicate Margot Wendice, Ray Milland has retained his charismatically cloaked deviousness as Tony Wendice, who is in the market for a murdered wife, and my second time watching the film has given me a huge appreciation for the very humorous performance by John Williams as the infallible Chief Inspector Hubbard.\nThe strengths of Dial M for the Murder, and the reasons why it is a classic, are the strong performances by the cast, the intelligent screenplay from Frederick Knott (based on his play of the same name), and of course, the Master of Suspense behind the camera. Rarely do plays adapted for the screen work as well as this one. The quality of Dial M for Murder is in the same league as Sleuth (1972), which is high praise from me considering Sleuth is by far my favourite film of all-time.\nI have trouble expressing how wonderful and fortunate Torontonians are to have a theatre like the Lightbox that is willing to screen Hitchcock classics, on actual film no less. If you grew up with Hitchcock films and want to feel nostalgic, or if you\u2019re younger and are feeling adventurous, I urge you to get down to the Lightbox in November or December as there are some amazing Hitchock screenings ahead of us.

{"context":"Press Release\nArgos Announces Issuance of Patent Covering the Foundation for Manufacturing its HIV Immunotherapy\nDURHAM, N.C., Feb. 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Argos Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:ARGS), an immuno-oncology company focused on the development and commercialization of individualized immunotherapies based on the Arcelis\u00ae precision immunotherapy technology platform, today announced the issuance of U.S. patent 9,879,053, covering the strain-independent amplification of human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, nucleic acid sequences for use in vaccinations.\nThe methods described in this patent form the foundation for the manufacture of AGS-004, Argos' novel, dendritic cell-based immunotherapy for HIV. AGS-004 consists of autologous dendritic cells electroporated with amplified virus RNA and CD40L RNA that are designed to stimulate T cells to attack HIV-infected cells. Because HIV has a high mutation rate, viral variants are different in each patient. The methods described in this patent are used to amplify RNA encoding the unique viral variants in an individual from a small amount of blood or infectious plasma from which the virus can be isolated. This allows the generation of immunotherapies that are matched to the unique pathogen mutations in a specific individual, thus facilitating the development of a customized immunotherapy that may be more effective at controlling or eliminating the pathogen. The claims in this patent are directed to AGS-004, methods of manufacturing AGS-004 and methods of treatment utilizing AGS-004.\nAGS-004 is currently being evaluated in an investigator sponsored Phase 2 clinical trial in combination with the latency-reversing agent vorinostat under the direction of David Margolis, M.D., Professor of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, and Director of the HIV Cure Center at the University of North Carolina. The latent viral reservoir consists of infected immune cells in which the HIV virus is dormant and therefore hidden from attack by the immune system. Largely because of the latent viral reservoir, currently available agents for the treatment of HIV, while able to limit the proliferation of the HIV virus, have not been successful in eradicating the virus and thus curing HIV. The trial is designed to test the hypothesis that boosting antiviral immunity with AGS-004 combined with a latency reversing drug to expose the virus in latently infected cells to the immune system may enable eradication of the virus.\n\"We believe that our ability to customize the immune response to patients' unique viral variants, particularly to those variants persisting in the latent viral reservoir, offers a scientifically compelling rationale for this study,\" noted Irina Tcherepanova, Ph.D., vice president of translational medicine, Argos Therapeutics. Initial data from the ongoing clinical trial is expected during the second half the patents and patent applications owned or licensed by the Company, such as the patent referred to in this release, will protect the Company's technology and prevent others from infringing it;","question":"What is the purpose of the U.S. patent 9,879,053 issued to Argos Therapeutics Inc.?","answer":"The U.S. patent 9,879,053 issued to Argos Therapeutics Inc. covers the strain-independent amplification of human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, nucleic acid sequences for use in vaccinations.

The songs have the best feel of high energy, emotions, fun, joy and everything that it needs to impress listeners.\nVerdict : Suriya-Anirudh-Vignesh Shivn trio sparkle in this Chartbuster with great music.\n#ThaanaSerndhaKoottam #VigneshShivn #Suriya #KeerthySuresh #studioGreen #Anirudh #ThaanaSerndhaKoottamMusicReview\nHowever been one of the top heroines in Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam, Keerthy Suresh has been well...\nDirected by \u2018Uriyadi\u2019 fame Director Vijay Kumar and bankrolled by himself under the banner of...\nProduced under the grand banner of \u2018Lyca Productions\u2019, the shooting of K V Anand\u2019s directorial...\n"}

{"context":"Non-Functional Requirements in an Agile World\nAs an Agile enthusiast I\u2019ve always rejected \u2018Requirements\u2019 as being old-school and contrary to the Agile way. However I\u2019ve just come across Roxanne Millar\u2019s book \u2018The Quest for Software requirements: Probing questions to bring Non-functional requirements [NFRs] into focus\u2019.\nWhile I am still a firm believer in User Stories for the functional aspect I am aware that that getting the Non-functional aspects covered effectively is vital, but rarely mentioned in Agile circles.\nThis article refers to the Scaled methods:\n- Disciplined Agile [Ambler]\n- SAFe [SAFe].\nSAFe describes NFRs as \u201cpersistent qualities and constraints\u201d.\nMany NFRs begin their lives as \u2018Enablers\u2019 that need to be addressed. Thereafter they constrain the system and all new Backlog items going forward. [SAFe]\nMike Cohn [Cohn] believes many NFRs can fit as User stories, however, responses to his blog post present alternatives ideas.\nJan Kees Velthoven [2013 \u2013 Responding to Cohn\u2019s post] proposes an alternative format:\nAs an [actor] I must [constraint] otherwise [fact or argument]\nScott Ambler [Ambler] would call these Technical stories.\nIn reality NFRs, including architectural implementations do not fit simply into the User story model. Some relate to a single User story \/ other Product Backlog Item (PBI) and may be part of the acceptance criteria, some are global; however, many relate to various subsets of the User stories. These are probably the hardest to deal with. A major error is wrongly assuming an NFR is global.\nAmbler would record those which are not stories or Acceptance criteria items in a list for developers and testers to manage. In this he is following the RUP concept of \u2018Supplementary Requirements\u2019 listing all NFRs.\nSome NFRs, once delivered, can be added to the Definition of done so that subsequent User stories conform to them. SAFe extends this concept to iterations, program increments and Releases. It defines it in the \u2018SAFe Requirements model\u2019 presenting a highly structured set of relationships between Backlog items, NFRs and System qualities tests.\nSurprisingly, in her book, Millar ignores Tom Gilb\u2019s Planguage, see [Gilb], (developed over decades) which offers an excellent way of approaching metrics for NFRs, replacing the more common vague statements which stakeholders generally offer. Although SAFe states that when specifying NFRs they should be Bounded; Negotiable; Independent and Testable it fails to suggest any further level of definition of individual NFRs, at least in the material referenced below. However, it does point out that a small increment to an NFR may have a dramatic cost implication, don\u2019t just let stakeholders assume linearity. Uptime is a good example \u2013 see [SAFe].\nGilb says:\n\u201c\u2026it is essential that the explicit notion of quantification be added to agile concepts\u201d. \u201cQuality is Scalar, hence variable and measurable\u201d.\nUser stories commence life as Epics and are then further defined as they get nearer to implementation. Is this approach appropriate for NFRs too? Most NFRs can be defined with a range however this goal does not generally need to be achieved in the early stages. In the Agile world we benefit from learning and adapting as we go along, consequently NFRs should be adjusted accordingly.\nAfter defining, the NFRs need to be valued \u2013 See Shopping cart mentality in FURPS+ article [IBM].\nIs it necessary to define the NFRs upfront?\nThere are some reasons why this could be of value:\nGabrielle Benefield and Susan Atkinson find Gilb\u2019s Planguage valuable in defining Agile contracts where payment should be staged and based on Business Value delivered. Adam Russell [Responding to Cohn in 2011] points out that NFRs should be identified in Business cases so that the Business can decide whether, say, a 5% increase in an NFR is actually worth the cost.\nRussell believes NFRs should always be expressed upfront:\nto start the process of focusing your attention on what qualities are valued in your target user population, and developing the team vocabulary to describe and analyse them\nA lot of effort could be expended on managing NFRs, however the effort should relate to the value delivered. Hence an NFR which goes up exponentially in cost as the scale is increased is worthy of a fair amount of effort!\nAs with Functional requirements, NFRs are not completely visible at the start of a project so a framework such as FURPS+ [IBM] can be useful in scanning for them.\nFrom an Agile perspective, I would recommend that both NFRs and their metrics are regularly reviewed during planning sessions as, inevitably, more becomes known.\nThe delivery Roadmap needs to incorporate the NFRs showing at what point each is expected to be implemented unless it is recorded as a PBI. With the Roadmap displayed on the wall everyone should be aware of the situation and it should be reviewed in each planning session. This is probably the best way of handling Ambler\u2019s recommendation of using the Lean principle of Deferring commitment\nConclusion\nMy conclusion is that those of us in the Agile world needs to take Non-Functional Requirements much more seriously if we want to deliver Agile effectively.\nReferences:\n- [Ambler] Strategies for Implementing Non-Functional Requirements\n- [Benefield] Lean Agile Legal Contracts for outsourcing \u2013 Gabrielle Benefield\n- [Cohn] Non-functional Requirements as User Stories\n- [Gilb] What\u2019s Wrong With Agile Methods \u2013Some Principles and Values to Encourage Quantification \u2013 Gilb & Brodie 2007\n- [IBM] Capturing Architectural Requirements IBM 2005\n- [SAFe] Nonfunctional Requirements Abstract","question":"What does SAFe describe Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) as?","answer":"SAFe describes NFRs as \u201cpersistent qualities and constraints\u201d.","question_with_prompt":"What does SAFe describe Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) as?\n","target_context":"Non-Functional Requirements in an Agile World\nAs an Agile enthusiast I\u2019ve always rejected \u2018Requirements\u2019 as being old-school and contrary to the Agile way.

Some relate to a single User story \/ other Product Backlog Item (PBI) and may be part of the acceptance criteria, some are global; however, many relate to various subsets of the User stories. These are probably the hardest to deal with. A major error is wrongly assuming an NFR is global.\nAmbler would record those which are not stories or Acceptance criteria items in a list for developers and testers to manage. In this he is following the RUP concept of \u2018Supplementary Requirements\u2019 listing all NFRs.\nSome NFRs, once delivered, can be added to the Definition of done so that subsequent User stories conform to them. SAFe extends this concept to iterations, program increments and Releases. It defines it in the \u2018SAFe Requirements model\u2019 presenting a highly structured set of relationships between Backlog items, NFRs and System qualities tests.\nSurprisingly, in her book, Millar ignores Tom Gilb\u2019s Planguage, see [Gilb], (developed over decades) which offers an excellent way of approaching metrics for NFRs, replacing the more common vague statements which stakeholders generally offer. Although SAFe states that when specifying NFRs they should be Bounded; Negotiable; Independent and Testable it fails to suggest any further level of definition of individual NFRs, at least in the material referenced below. However, it does point out that a small increment to an NFR may have a dramatic cost implication, don\u2019t just let stakeholders assume linearity. Uptime is a good example \u2013 see [SAFe].\nGilb says:\n\u201c\u2026it is essential that the explicit notion of quantification be added to agile concepts\u201d. \u201cQuality is Scalar, hence variable and measurable\u201d.\nUser stories commence life as Epics and are then further defined as they get nearer to implementation. Is this approach appropriate for NFRs too? Most NFRs can be defined with a range however this goal does not generally need to be achieved in the early stages. In the Agile world we benefit from learning and adapting as we go along, consequently NFRs should be adjusted accordingly.\nAfter defining, the NFRs need to be valued \u2013 See Shopping cart mentality in FURPS+ article [IBM].\nIs it necessary to define the NFRs upfront?\nThere are some reasons why this could be of value:\nGabrielle Benefield and Susan Atkinson find Gilb\u2019s Planguage valuable in defining Agile contracts where payment should be staged and based on Business Value delivered. Adam Russell [Responding to Cohn in 2011] points out that NFRs should be identified in Business cases so that the Business can decide whether, say, a 5% increase in an NFR is actually worth the cost.\nRussell believes NFRs should always be expressed upfront:\nto start the process of focusing your attention on what qualities are valued in your target user population, and developing the team vocabulary to describe and analyse them\nA lot of effort could be expended on managing NFRs, however the effort should relate to the value delivered. Hence an NFR which goes up exponentially in cost as the scale is increased is worthy of a fair amount of effort!\nAs with Functional requirements, NFRs are not completely visible at the start of a project so a framework such as FURPS+ [IBM] can be useful in scanning for them.\nFrom an Agile perspective, I would recommend that both NFRs and their metrics are regularly reviewed during planning sessions as, inevitably, more becomes known.\nThe delivery Roadmap needs to incorporate the NFRs showing at what point each is expected to be implemented unless it is recorded as a PBI. With the Roadmap displayed on the wall everyone should be aware of the situation and it should be reviewed in each planning session. This is probably the best way of handling Ambler\u2019s recommendation of using the Lean principle of Deferring commitment\nConclusion\nMy conclusion is that those of us in the Agile world needs to take Non-Functional Requirements much more seriously if we want to deliver Agile effectively.\nReferences:\n- [Ambler] Strategies for Implementing Non-Functional Requirements\n- [Benefield] Lean Agile Legal Contracts for outsourcing \u2013 Gabrielle Benefield\n- [Cohn] Non-functional Requirements as User Stories\n- [Gilb] What\u2019s Wrong With Agile Methods \u2013Some Principles and Values to Encourage Quantification \u2013 Gilb & Brodie 2007\n- [IBM] Capturing Architectural Requirements IBM 2005\n- [SAFe] Nonfunctional Requirements Abstract\n"}

First, it's silky and moisturizes really well, but unlike other effective moisturizers, it's not heavy or greasy. Most hand lotions either feel super-slippery or make your hands feel dirty afterwards because they're so heavy. This hits the Goldilocks zone.\nSecond, it has a fresh citrus-y smell that gives you a pick me up and then GOES AWAY. I'm not a huge scent person so don't like heavy, perfumed hand lotions that stay with you for ages. This is just enough to give a nice whiff of a refreshing scent while you're rubbing it in and then you can go back to your day.\nSo really, it's perfect. I actually go on and on about this lotion so much that once I was in the NY store at the counter and a woman behind me picked it up to look at it, and I started telling her how great it was until she decided to buy it. Because I had basically just sold a bottle of lotion, the sales lady who was ringing me up slyly put extra samples in my bag. So great lotion AND great store!

{"context":"In 1971, NASA sent three astronauts who were University alumni to the moon as part of the Apollo 15 lunar mission. Now, three University professors have been chosen for a new NASA project, one that believes many answers may be blowing in the wind.\nOn Monday, NASA announced that a team of Michigan University professors - Christopher Ruf, professor of atmospheric, oceanic and space sciences and electrical engineering and computer sciences; Aaron Ridley, associate professor of atmospheric, oceanic and space sciences; and Derek Posselt, assistant professor of atmospheric, oceanic and space sciences - were chosen to receive $151.7 million over the next five years to undertake their Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System project.\nThe project aims to simultaneously launch eight satellites by 2016 that will spend at least two years in space where they will gather data about cyclones and other tropical storms that previous technology found difficult to provide because of the difficulty of studying inside oceanic storms.\nThe team of professors beat out 18 other teams that submitted proposals when the agency offered an opportunity for funds for small spaceflight investigations in Earth's system, made possible by the Earth Venture-class series of projects in NASA's Earth Science Division.\nThe University professors will partner with Southwest Research Institute of Texas, Surrey Satellite Technology of Colorado and the NASA Ames Research Center to build the satellites and gather data that can be used for research.\nIn Earth's orbit, the satellites' functions will include probing the interaction between seawater and air and how that interaction has a role in the development of hurricanes and other tropical storms.\nRuf, the project's principal investigator, said the satellites will be up in space to monitor hurricanes for at least two hurricane seasons but noted that while the satellites are designed for a two-year lifetime, they may last longer.\n\"The first one is like a training session, to make sure everything is working and tune up all of the electronics properly, and then the second year we'll be able to really do it,\" Ruf said.\nRuf said their mission was attractive to NASA because their satellites are smaller and less expensive than previous satellites.\n\"There's several different ways of looking at the surface conditions that have been flying since the 1970s, and the more traditional ways are much bigger and much more expensive,\" he said.\nRuf added that the satellites' technology will allow for a mission that will be the first of its kind.\n\"As far as using this kind of technology specifically, it's been demonstrated twice before on satellites, but they were just these little demonstrations, things that only lasted for a few weeks to show that the idea was sound,\" Ruf said. \"But there was never like a full, concerted mission to do sustained science.\"\nRuf said the team also extensively researched cyclones before submitting the proposal.\n\"We did a lot of historical analysis ... as part of the design study for how many satellites we would need and the detail about their design so we would be able to see a lot of hurricanes,\" Ruf said.\nThe mission will focus on taking measurements of hurricanes during the hurricanes, which hasn't been done before, according to Ruf.\n\"(Old satellites) stopped working well as soon as you get close to the middle of the hurricane because there is too much rain, and this new technique can see right through the rain well, so that's a big-deal thing,\" Ruf said.\nRuf added that studying such hard-to-reach areas of the storms can help meteorologists better forecast the intensity of hurricanes in the future.\nPosselt said he joined the project to further investigate convection as a general topic, rather than solely tropical cyclones.\n\"My task on this is ... to explore uses of this data to try to understand tropical precipitation,\" Posselt said.\nPosselt added that smaller storms are important to study as well.\n\"In the last five or 10 years or so, there's been a more concerted effort to try to understand these tropical systems, partly because they can give rise to hurricanes down the road if they persist long enough and organize in the right way,\" Posselt said.\nPosselt added that NASA saw how their proposal would benefit science without an exorbitant cost.\n\"So for NASA, I think this probably fell in a bit of a sweet spot ... it's a measurement that we don't have globally but it's using technology that we don't have to spend tens of millions of dollars developing,\" Posselt said.\nNASA spokesman Steve Cole said this mission will provide NASA with the kind of cutting-edge study of Earth they look for.\n\"NASA does a lot of research into developing for new ways to use the vantage point of space, having instruments in space to study weather, hurricanes, all sorts of earth science,\" Cole said. \"We've had a number of missions that study winds ... and this mission is kind of pushing the envelope.\"\nCole added that it is somewhat unique for NASA to have a university-led mission.\n\"Most NASA missions are done not at universities, but we do have a history in a wide range of sciences of what we call P.I.-led missions. We have them in planet science and solar science,\" Cole said.","question":"What is the main objective of the Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System project led by the team of Michigan University professors?","answer":"The main objective of the Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System project is to launch eight satellites by 2016 that will spend at least two years in space gathering data about cyclones and other tropical storms.

Aaron Ridley, associate professor of atmospheric, oceanic and space sciences; and Derek Posselt, assistant professor of atmospheric, oceanic and space sciences - were chosen to receive $151.7 million over the next five years to undertake their Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System project.\nThe project aims to simultaneously launch eight satellites by 2016 that will spend at least two years in space where they will gather data about cyclones and other tropical storms that previous technology found difficult to provide because of the difficulty of studying inside oceanic storms.\nThe team of professors beat out 18 other teams that submitted proposals when the agency offered an opportunity for funds for small spaceflight investigations in Earth's system, made possible by the Earth Venture-class series of projects in NASA's Earth Science Division.\nThe University professors will partner with Southwest Research Institute of Texas, Surrey Satellite Technology of Colorado and the NASA Ames Research Center to build the satellites and gather data that can be used for research.\nIn Earth's orbit, the satellites' functions will include probing the interaction between seawater and air and how that interaction has a role in the development of hurricanes and other tropical storms.\nRuf, the project's principal investigator, said the satellites will be up in space to monitor hurricanes for at least two hurricane seasons but noted that while the satellites are designed for a two-year lifetime, they may last longer.\n\"The first one is like a training session, to make sure everything is working and tune up all of the electronics properly, and then the second year we'll be able to really do it,\" Ruf said.\nRuf said their mission was attractive to NASA because their satellites are smaller and less expensive than previous satellites.\n\"There's several different ways of looking at the surface conditions that have been flying since the 1970s, and the more traditional ways are much bigger and much more expensive,\" he said.\nRuf added that the satellites' technology will allow for a mission that will be the first of its kind.\n\"As far as using this kind of technology specifically, it's been demonstrated twice before on satellites, but they were just these little demonstrations, things that only lasted for a few weeks to show that the idea was sound,\" Ruf said. \"But there was never like a full, concerted mission to do sustained science.\"\nRuf said the team also extensively researched cyclones before submitting the proposal.\n\"We did a lot of historical analysis ... as part of the design study for how many satellites we would need and the detail about their design so we would be able to see a lot of hurricanes,\" Ruf said.\nThe mission will focus on taking measurements of hurricanes during the hurricanes, which hasn't been done before, according to Ruf.\n\"(Old satellites) stopped working well as soon as you get close to the middle of the hurricane because there is too much rain, and this new technique can see right through the rain well, so that's a big-deal thing,\" Ruf said.\nRuf added that studying such hard-to-reach areas of the storms can help meteorologists better forecast the intensity of hurricanes in the future.\nPosselt said he joined the project to further investigate convection as a general topic, rather than solely tropical cyclones.\n\"My task on this is ... to explore uses of this data to try to understand tropical precipitation,\" Posselt said.\nPosselt added that smaller storms are important to study as well.\n\"In the last five or 10 years or so, there's been a more concerted effort to try to understand these tropical systems, partly because they can give rise to hurricanes down the road if they persist long enough and organize in the right way,\" Posselt said.\nPosselt added that NASA saw how their proposal would benefit science without an exorbitant cost.\n\"So for NASA, I think this probably fell in a bit of a sweet spot ... it's a measurement that we don't have globally but it's using technology that we don't have to spend tens of millions of dollars developing,\" Posselt said.\nNASA spokesman Steve Cole said this mission will provide NASA with the kind of cutting-edge study of Earth they look for.\n\"NASA does a lot of research into developing for new ways to use the vantage point of space, having instruments in space to study weather, hurricanes, all sorts of earth science,\" Cole said. \"We've had a number of missions that study winds ... and this mission is kind of pushing the envelope.\"\nCole added that it is somewhat unique for NASA to have a university-led mission.\n\"Most NASA missions are done not at universities, but we do have a history in a wide range of sciences of what we call P.I.-led missions. We have them in planet science and solar science,\" Cole said.\n"}

{"context":"High Priest\u2019s Garments - The Anointing and Significance of Blue\nContinuing with the series on High Priest, here is an excerpt from my sermon notes. (Skipping last week\u2019s sermon on linen.) I did my best to summarize it, but this sermon is really oozing with revelations. Be blessed!\nFirst off, the robe of the ephod (Exo 28:31-35). Note that the opening for the head was reinforced so that it cannot be torn. The High Priest cannot tear clothes by the law. (Lev 21:10) However, Caiaphas, the High Priest at the time of Jesus\u2019 crucifixion, tore his clothes. (Mat 26:65, Mar 14:63) He broke the law. Without knowing it, what he did signified the change of order of priesthood.\nJesus is our High Priest, after the order of Melchizedek. The only difference between Jesus and the Israel High Priests is the order of priesthood. In Aaronic priesthood, the priests blessed only on the condition of obedience, and cursed if there was disobedience, in accordance with the law. (Lev 26:3-29) In Melchizedek priesthood, however, as seen in the book of Genesis, Melchizedek always blessed. He blessed Abraham (then Abram) and the Father, and gave Abraham bread and wine. In fact, the first word that came out of his mouth was \u201cblessed\u201d. (Gen 14:19) So Jesus, our High Priest in the order or Melchizedek, always speaks and does blessings.\nRemember that the law demands righteousness, while grace gives righteousness. Under grace, even when you fail, you still receive blessings, and this will make you want to do right.\nNext, we look at the anointing of the priesthood in Exodus 29:4-10. In verse 7, there was the anointing of Aaron as High Priest. Then, from verse 10, animals were brought and slaughtered; it was not until verse 21, after the animals were slaughtered, that Aaron\u2019s sons were anointed.\nAs Aaron was the High Priest and his sons were priests, today, as we are a royal priesthood with Jesus as our High Priest, Aaron\u2019s sons was a type of us. This is a beautiful picture of what happened. Jesus Christ was anointed before He died. We were anointed after His death, which was signified by the animals\u2019 sacrifice.\nOne more thing about the High Priest\u2019s anointing is the divine order found in this ordination. When the High Priest is anointed, oil flows from the High Priest\u2019s head down his beard before it reaches his body. This is depicted in a psalm, Psalm 133:1-3.\nThe order his head, beard, body (all the way to the edge). So this is God\u2019s order: blessing goes from the head, which is the pastors, then to the elders, signified by the beard, then to the body, that is the entire church. Due to this order, when you pray for your pastors, you are, in fact, praying for yourself, because as the leader goes, so goes the church. Do not be jealous when the pastors get blessed; know that you are next in line! Hallelujah!\nBack to Exodus 28:31, the robe of the ephod is blue in colour.\nNow blue, as we learned, is the heavenly colour. It speaks of divinity. However, there is another, deeper meaning to blue. We look at the Hebrew word for blue: \u201ctekheleth\u201d. This word comes from another word in Hebrew: \u201ckahlah\u201d. Kahlah means perfection, completeness. At the Cross, perfection is displayed, as God\u2019s holiness kissed God\u2019s mercy, and God\u2019s demand met God\u2019s provision.\nThere is one ordination that God made in Numbers 15:37-39. God commanded the Israelites to make the tassels, and you still see it in today\u2019s Israel. In face, the Pharisees\u2019 tassels were longer than usual, to show of their \u201cspiritual\u201d status.\nThe tassels on the corners of garments had a blue thread to it. Why is this significant?\nIn Luke 8:43-44, a woman with the issue of blood came to Jesus. She was poor (spent all her money on physicians) and sick, so she was doubly sorrowful. She touched the border, that is, the corner, of Jesus\u2019 garment, and she was healed. Now, on the corners of Jesus\u2019 garment were the tassels with a blue thread. The woman touched completion of a perfect work. Blue speaks of the finished work of Jesus, of completeness. Now, please don\u2019t go out from church and buy blue clothes or wear the tassels; these things were outward for our study that you may know that because of Jesus\u2019 finished work: you are complete in Him. Hallelujah!\nGood related information! I have been hunting for everything like that for quite a while currently.

{"context":"Just the beginning for \u201dBubba\u201d\nby Peter Schwartz On Thu, Jun. 15, 2017\nAfter his Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series debut, Darrell Wallace Jr. continues his journey in Michigan.\nThe reality was that \u201cBubba\u201d made his Monster Energy Cup Series debut driving the famous #43 and became just the 4th African-American driver to ever participate in the highest level of NASCAR.\n\u201cI will cheer up,\u201d said the 23 year old Wallace after the race. \u201cThis was a wonderful day for me, a wonderful day for the sport. I wish we could have got a little bit better finish in our Smithfield Ford, but I\u2019m just thankful for the opportunity. I\u2019ve been dreaming about this since I was a little kid and now it\u2019s here, and I made a name for myself. We\u2019ll build off of it. I\u2019ll practice more with the dash and go debrief with the team, and we\u2019ll just get better.\u201d\nWith those words, Wallace put it all into perspective and showed a great deal of maturity but also the passion to get better. He might have been down a bit after the race, but the magnitude of his accomplishment in getting to that moment in his career is what he will remember most about his historic day and not necessarily the speeding penalties that he attained during the course of the day.\nWith all of those thoughts racing through his head, Wallace went through a whirlwind of emotions. After the race, he had a very productive conversation with RPM Co-Owner Andrew Murstein.\n\u201cWe spoke and he was upset with the speeding penalties and he was beating himself up a little bit,\u201d said Murstein. \u201cI loved to see that. It tells me how hungry he is. It reminded me a little of (the movie) \u201cTalladega Nights\u201d and the line \u201cIf you\u2019re not first your last.\u201d He wants nothing short of a win eventually. I told him that every long journey starts with a first step. Pocono was his first step in what should be a long and very successful career.\u201d\nWhile he had mixed emotions about his performance at Pocono, Wallace certainly had a lot to smile about for a couple of reasons. 1st of all, it was an historic day for him just to be in the race and his good friend Ryan Blaney notched his 1st career win driving the iconic #21 car for Woods Brother Racing.\nThe two buddies had a nice chat before the race about how getting to this point and representing these two teams was pretty surreal.\n\u201cI loved how you had two young men in Bubba and Ryan talking before the race about how cool it was that they were driving arguably the two most prestigious numbers in the sport. They have great respect for the tradition and history of NASCAR. \u201cThat\u2019s great to see and unfortunately is rare amount many athletes in other sports.\u201d\nWallace will certainly remember that 1st day in a Monster Energy Cup Series race for a long time, but for the moment it\u2019s time to turn the page and move on to the next race this Sunday in Michigan for the \u201cFireKeepers Casino 400\u201d. It\u2019s a fast track that Wallace is very comfortable with.\n\u201cI like that place,\u201d said Wallace. \u201cI think I run a little bit better at Michigan. I\u2019m looking forward to it. (Pocono) is a first step. I know we ran a good, clean race, and that\u2019s all you can ask, didn\u2019t wreck the car, brought it home in one piece, so I\u2019m pumped for the guys.\u201d\nIt\u2019s always good to see a little from an athlete, regardless of what sport it is. While Wallace was beating himself up over his mistakes at Pocono, he\u2019s using it as motivation to get better starting this week in Michigan. The great ones have that ability to turn adversity into prosperity. \u201cBubba\u201d is still climbing the ladder but has already shown what type of competitor he is.\n\u201cI like how hungry he is and he also seems to see the big picture,\u201d said Murstein. \u201cThe great ones have that. I often talked about that with my friend (Pro Football Hall of Famer) Jim Brown, who I took to a NASCAR race last year. He realizes that athletes can be more than just an athlete and can affect the way people view the world. Having Bubba succeed in this sport will be a great thing for everyone.\u201d\nWallace earned this opportunity with RPM because of what he accomplished in the NASCAR XfINITY Series and Camping World Truck Series where he notched five career wins. With that 1st victory, the graduate of NASCAR\u2019s \u201cDrive for Diversity\u201d program became the 1st African-American to win a NASCAR race since Hall of famer Wendell Scott.\nBut now he has reached the highest level of the sport and the competition is second to none.\n\u201cThese guys are good,\u201d said Wallace. \u201cThese guys are here for a reason.

I wish we could have got a little bit better finish in our Smithfield Ford, but I\u2019m just thankful for the opportunity. I\u2019ve been dreaming about this since I was a little kid and now it\u2019s here, and I made a name for myself. We\u2019ll build off of it. I\u2019ll practice more with the dash and go debrief with the team, and we\u2019ll just get better.\u201d\nWith those words, Wallace put it all into perspective and showed a great deal of maturity but also the passion to get better. He might have been down a bit after the race, but the magnitude of his accomplishment in getting to that moment in his career is what he will remember most about his historic day and not necessarily the speeding penalties that he attained during the course of the day.\nWith all of those thoughts racing through his head, Wallace went through a whirlwind of emotions. After the race, he had a very productive conversation with RPM Co-Owner Andrew Murstein.\n\u201cWe spoke and he was upset with the speeding penalties and he was beating himself up a little bit,\u201d said Murstein. \u201cI loved to see that. It tells me how hungry he is. It reminded me a little of (the movie) \u201cTalladega Nights\u201d and the line \u201cIf you\u2019re not first your last.\u201d He wants nothing short of a win eventually. I told him that every long journey starts with a first step. Pocono was his first step in what should be a long and very successful career.\u201d\nWhile he had mixed emotions about his performance at Pocono, Wallace certainly had a lot to smile about for a couple of reasons. 1st of all, it was an historic day for him just to be in the race and his good friend Ryan Blaney notched his 1st career win driving the iconic #21 car for Woods Brother Racing.\nThe two buddies had a nice chat before the race about how getting to this point and representing these two teams was pretty surreal.\n\u201cI loved how you had two young men in Bubba and Ryan talking before the race about how cool it was that they were driving arguably the two most prestigious numbers in the sport. They have great respect for the tradition and history of NASCAR. \u201cThat\u2019s great to see and unfortunately is rare amount many athletes in other sports.\u201d\nWallace will certainly remember that 1st day in a Monster Energy Cup Series race for a long time, but for the moment it\u2019s time to turn the page and move on to the next race this Sunday in Michigan for the \u201cFireKeepers Casino 400\u201d. It\u2019s a fast track that Wallace is very comfortable with.\n\u201cI like that place,\u201d said Wallace. \u201cI think I run a little bit better at Michigan. I\u2019m looking forward to it. (Pocono) is a first step. I know we ran a good, clean race, and that\u2019s all you can ask, didn\u2019t wreck the car, brought it home in one piece, so I\u2019m pumped for the guys.\u201d\nIt\u2019s always good to see a little from an athlete, regardless of what sport it is. While Wallace was beating himself up over his mistakes at Pocono, he\u2019s using it as motivation to get better starting this week in Michigan. The great ones have that ability to turn adversity into prosperity. \u201cBubba\u201d is still climbing the ladder but has already shown what type of competitor he is.\n\u201cI like how hungry he is and he also seems to see the big picture,\u201d said Murstein. \u201cThe great ones have that. I often talked about that with my friend (Pro Football Hall of Famer) Jim Brown, who I took to a NASCAR race last year. He realizes that athletes can be more than just an athlete and can affect the way people view the world. Having Bubba succeed in this sport will be a great thing for everyone.\u201d\nWallace earned this opportunity with RPM because of what he accomplished in the NASCAR XfINITY Series and Camping World Truck Series where he notched five career wins. With that 1st victory, the graduate of NASCAR\u2019s \u201cDrive for Diversity\u201d program became the 1st African-American to win a NASCAR race since Hall of famer Wendell Scott.\nBut now he has reached the highest level of the sport and the competition is second to none.\n\u201cThese guys are good,\u201d said Wallace. \u201cThese guys are here for a reason. There\u2019s no more climbing. I\u2019ve been in the ladder rungs for the last couple years and now I\u2019m at the top. There\u2019s nothing else I can do but just to go out there and just get better and better and learn how this sport works and how this series works.\u201d\nWith RPM, Wallace is filling in for the injured Aric Almirola who is expected to return later this season after suffering a compression fracture of the T5 vertebra in a crash May 13th at Kansas Speedway.

{"context":"When one considers all the national and global crises that dominated the 2015 headlines, 2016 has the potential to be one of those landmark years that could change history.\nIn my lifetime, 1968 falls into that category.

This knocked \u201cjob creation and economic growth\u201d from the number-one spot, down to number two, at 23 percent.

I\u2019ve worked with thousands of computer consultants and routinely see them commit one major mistake in their MSP marketing plan.\nThis minor oversight kills any chance of convincing new (and existing!) customers to purchase managed services \u2014 and wastes their precious time and investment in the process.\nIt\u2019s not an obvious mistake in their managed services marketing campaigns \u2014 like a missing headline, offer, or testimonials. It\u2019s emotional logic and persistence.\nChange The Conversation In Your MSP Marketing Plan\nToo often, MSPs focus on what managed services is and what it does in their marketing messaging. That won\u2019t convince anyone to do anything. Heck, most won\u2019t take 3 seconds to read your flyer.\nTo connect with MSP leads, you have to understand where they\u2019re coming from, and apply that emotional intelligence across your MSP marketing plan.\nUse these proven tips for more targeted and effective MSP marketing messaging:\nTap Into Customer Motivations:\nSuccessful sales boils down to understanding human motivations. People purchase for self-serving reasons. They don\u2019t buy because they should, because it\u2019s right, or because they need it. If that were the case, we\u2019d all buy (and eat) healthy food, take our vitamins, invest for retirement, and kick bad habits that keep us sick, broke, and fat.\nWhen selling managed IT services, you first have to ask: What would motivate someone to buy this type of service? There are two primary MSP personas you need to acknowledge in your plan:\nCrisis Mode Customers\nIf a company experiences constant network problems, they\u2019re more likely to buy. For this type of client, you have to demonstrate why they should trust you to solve their pain over all other available options.\nThis is why I strongly recommend a stay-in-touch marketing system for all unconverted MSP leads. You don\u2019t know when their network will finally break, so you want to constantly stay in touch. That way, they\u2019ll think of you when it eventually does OR when their current IT person has committed the \u201clast straw.\u201d\nComplacent Customers\nBut what about the client who is NOT experiencing problems? Why would they buy managed services? What would motivate them to \u201cfix\u201d something that ain\u2019t broke?\nIn a sense, these types of managed IT services leads need to be \u201cscared straight.\u201d They need to be educated about the devastating problems that can crop up when a network is not maintained, secured, and monitored. They must feel uneasy about their data security and network health and \u201csee\u201d how a fatal crash would affect their business. It\u2019s your job to convince them YOU are the one to help them avoid these fatal outcomes.\nHere are two example email marketing messages for this type of persona from my Million-Dollar Managed Services Marketing Blueprint:\nEducate to Win in MSP Sales\nThe sales landscape has shifted. You can no longer feed people messages you want them to hear. Competition for managed IT services leads is fiercer than ever, and buyers now have the upper hand.\nIf you want prospects to read your marketing and act on it, you\u2019ll need to take the time to educate the client in a powerful, convincing, and interesting way. You can accomplish this by incorporating seminars, teleseminars, thought leadership articles, audio recordings, long sales letters, or free reports in your MSP marketing plan.\nIf you do that and constantly hammer your message home, they will (eventually) reach the purchase tipping point. I don\u2019t know when, and some MSP customers will take longer than others. But the key is to consistently do the right things, in the right way, long enough to have impact.\nBreak The Mold And Sell More Managed Services Contracts\nTransitioning from a break-fix to managed services model is not easy. Without targeted, consistent messaging in place, you will likely lose out to another MSP who\u2019s there when the need arises.\nI\u2019ve helped thousands of computer consultants and MSPs emerge from the trenches and build sustainable managed services revenue models.\nAre you ready to do the same?\nMy Million-Dollar Managed Services Marketing Blueprint exposes actual campaigns and strategies that other small computer consultants have used to double or triple their annual revenue, launch a profitable managed services practice, and transform the way they do business.\nIn this program, you\u2019ll also learn:\n- How to avoid wasting thousands of dollars on marketing campaigns that don\u2019t work.

That won\u2019t convince anyone to do anything.

People purchase for self-serving reasons. They don\u2019t buy because they should, because it\u2019s right, or because they need it.

That is not to say that it is my least favorite modern story (that's a toss-up between Kill the Moon or Sleep No More), but it's the one that not only features the Daleks but exemplifies my frustration with them. How can I miss you if you won't go away? So let's talk about that. Daleks in Manhattan (TARDIS Data Core recap) This story, set in Depression-era New York City, features a wide array of American accents ranging from passable to truly awful. It also features a guest turn by Andrew Garfield a full half-decade before he would become Spider-Man. He's not very memorable in the role. Finally, it features four Daleks - none of whom ever shout, \"EXTERMINATE!\" It's like, what's the point of being a Dalek if you aren't going to do any exterminating? These four are the Cult of Skaro, who did an emergency time shift to escape the Battle of Canary Wharf during the previous season's finale, and they are behind a lengthy plot that involves turning humans into pig-faced slaves (I have no idea why Russel T Davies is so fascinated by the idea of pig monsters, maybe he once had a bad truffle-hunting vacation to France). Their plot also involves affixing some Dalekanium plates to the top mast of the under-construction Empire State Building so that they can do a whole Frankenstein thing and create a Dalek-Human hybrid. Because, of course. It's just... not good. When the first Dalek showed up in Dalek it was a chilling episode that was masterfully written. When they came back for the first season finale it was a shocking moment. When they came back again for the second season finale it was somewhat less shocking, but generally well done. By the time Hooverville of the Daleks rolls around it marks the sixth and seventh episodes with them in two-and-a-half years. Seriously, enough already. Even the Doctor is bored with them, he can barely work up a visceral \"oh nos they are going to destroy humanity\" moment. I dunno, maybe the bad American stereotypes play better in the U.K. God knows they must think our British and Scottish stereotypes are wretched. Honestly, though, I just could not care less about the doomed love story between showgirl Tallulah and PigMan Laszlo. And the fact that the cast list includes an actual credit for \"Hero Pig\" just sums it all up. Blech. Tomorrow I will slog through the back half of the story, Wednesday I will slog through The Lazarus Experiment, and then Thursday I can get back to enjoying this project. Honestly, I'd almost rather be watching Planet of Giants right now. At least that featured Barbara Wright, Goddess.

CEIBS is a private university that offers only graduate study in business, with an MBA and executive MBA (EMBA), as well as certificate programs. Both are ranked in the top 10 internationally for their business programs and have a number of impressive facilities, including a finance center that provides top-level consulting, research and workshops for the Chinese government and Chinese businesses.\nCEIBS is seeking accreditation from the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB), a move that will place more limits on its structure and actions but which, the administration feels, is necessary to recruit faculty and students internationally. UW Oshkosh is the only AACSB-accredited university in northeastern Wisconsin.\nThe University of Shanghai, a public university that primarily serves local students, offers semester-long and summer study programs taught in English for business students.\nOne of the major problems facing the Chinese education system is that there are more Chinese students seeking admission to universities than there are spots available. Just prior to the faculty\u2019s arrival, Hangzhou Foreign Language School (HFLS), an elite public high school, held its college entrance exam. The exams determine whether a student can seek admittance to a university as well as what level of university.\nUW Oshkosh\u2019s College of Business hopes to pursue a cooperative agreement with HFLS to guarantee admittance of five students per year to UW Oshkosh\u2019s business program.\nBusiness and industry\nThe faculty visited a number of different types of businesses. Industrial sites included a Chinese-owned textile factory; the Chinese-American-owned company PacRim that produces metal stamping and injection molding and a Kohler plant that produces faucets for the Chinese market.\n\u201cOne characteristic of all these factories was what is called \u2018Chinese-style\u2019 automation, a mix of technological and labor intensive production,\u201d Johnson said.\nNancy Sun, PacRim CEO and president, estimated that by 2012, the Chinese comparative advantage in cheap labor will disappear and costs of production in China and Mexico will be roughly equivalent.\nPacRim is considering two strategies in anticipation of the cost shifts: opening a plant in Mexico for supplying U.S. companies as well as shifting production to more sophisticated and specialized parts for green technologies.\nAnother characteristic of the companies\u2019 officers was a concern over rising input prices, including higher labor costs due to a new Chinese labor law requiring companies to provide a range of insurances for workers, higher commodity prices and higher energy prices.\n\u201cWe also learned that there are significant differences in government and tax treatment of Chinese-owned, joint-venture and wholly foreign-owned companies,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cFor those thinking of producing in China, negotiating government bureaucracy, labor laws, environmental laws and so forth can be very difficult, and there are advantages and disadvantages of each type of ownership structure that bear careful investigation.\u201d\nIn addition to factories, the faculty toured several service-provision organizations, including Wisconsin law firm Godfrey & Kahn, Nielson Market Research and Traffic Cast. Representatives of all three companies emphasized several shared themes: the rise of the Chinese middle class and of discretionary consumption and the vast differences in regional preferences and customs.\nNielson reported on the success of Pizza Hut and how the company addressed cultural differences between American and Chinese diners, such as the difficulty of selling salad to Chinese consumers. Traffic Cast provided evidence of the rising demand for consumer service products, including real-time traffic reports and forecasts.\nGovernment\nThe visiting faculty also met with governmental and international organizations, including a Wisconsin Department of Commerce representative, an officer of the U.S. Commercial Services Office and the American Chamber of Commerce president in Beijing.\n\u201cWhile all were largely positive about U.S. opportunities in China, they each stressed the importance of a careful entrance strategy, whether for producing or selling in China, and cautioned us on the necessity to do very thorough background checks on potential Chinese partners,\u201d Johnson said.\nTen years ago, most U.S. companies in China were manufacturing for the U.S. market; however, today most companies are manufacturing in China for the Chinese market \u2014 a big shift in strategy and operation, she said.\nIn Ninghai, the faculty had the chance to talk to Chinese governmental officials, including the mayor, deputy mayor and local Communist Party officials to learn about local politics and taxes.

I crept up to the top bunk and started kissing and smelling his head. He is all knees and elbows but his cheeks are still chubby. His fat cherub lips still pout when he sleeps. I nuzzled him until he finally woke to shrug me off. \"Momma? Daddy never does that,' he says to me in his brand new morning voice. \"I know, Love.\"\n\"Why you do that?\" he asks sort of annoyed. I sigh, trying to pick out the best reason for loving my children to death... I couldn't settle on one good reason, so I launched into something like: it's because you grew inside my belly for 9 months. It's because I lost all reason when you were born healthy and placed into my arms. It's because you are my proof that God is faithful and full of grace. It's because I watched your pensive face melt into your first smile. I felt the knobby ridge of your first tooth peek through your gummy smile that day in the bath tub. Your first step. The day you found my lipstick. The way you'd lick the top of your daddy's head when you were on his shoulders. The way you'd belly.laugh in your sling when I'd smash garlic when cooking your dinner... I watched you leave me to take your first bus ride. I held my breath as you finally returned to me that afternoon... All of this. All of these things. And all the things that will ever happen from here on out with you. It's endless. That's why.\nBy this point, we were thick into the decision of what to wear for Free Dress Day. I had several well coordinated outfits laid out for scrutiny. Naturally, none made the cut.

I'm coming off an incredibly successful and busy mustard.seed.photography year. There was no way I could expect the overwhelming response to my work. It's been amazing and I've grown so much professionally and personally. I'm 100% grateful for it all! But I'm a touch tired.

Corner windows are a trend, says JELD-WEN\u2019s Jennifer Matson. \u201cFor larger windows, like in living areas, fixed windows are just fine. We can make an inoperable window larger than one that operates.

Painted versus an actual metal frame is the preference because while home buyers may like the look, committing to a frame they may tire of in a few years is a concern. Especially since aluminum windows are costly to thermal break, says Matson, JELD-WEN\u2019S director of product line management for wood windows.\nBlack seems here to stay, but the palette for other darker colors is expanding. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the darker colored frames like dark brown and barn red and dark greens, and wood is really the substrate for that,\u201d says Matson. \u201cWe have refreshed that interior sash palette with gray\u2014and it may shift to a warmer brown-gray\u2014and some stains. We also do custom colors.\u201d\nEven in production building, where keeping costs in line is often at odds with trends, Philadelphia architect Jim Wentling will use smaller square windows as accents, usually in a Craftsman-style home, or a ribbon window in a ranch-style home.\nFlorida architect Tony Weremeichik likes to use floor-to-ceiling glass. \u201cThat\u2019s tough for production builders, but they can swap them out for double-hung units and gang them.\u201d To meet buyers\u2019 expectations, Weremeichik suggests builders try to get as much glass in their homes as possible within their means and budget.\nFor assistance with your 2019 projects, including incorporating window trends such as these, visit JELD-WEN\u2019s professional portal.","question":"What are the window trends for 2019 according to the context?","answer":"The window trends for 2019 include larger windows with minimal frames, unobstructed viewing fields, and a modern aesthetic with square and rectilinear shapes.

{"context":"I'm on the phone with Liza Minnelli, and all that involves. She's telling me she'll be singing mostly her signature tunes in her Seattle show, but that she'll also throw in a few surprises.\nTo even get to this point, I've had to promise her people not to discuss alcohol, rehab, or The Ex-Husband That Dare Not Speak His Name. I've also had to allow her manager, Danny, to listen in on the conversation from his mobile phone to ensure that I'll adhere to those promises. I'm not thrilled with the ground rules, though I agree to them. Come on\u2014it's Liza Minnelli. I'm not gay enough to have all her albums, but I am certainly gay enough to want to start an article with \"I'm on the phone with Liza Minnelli.\"\nShe sounds exactly like you think she does\u2014warm, weird, gushing, grand, punctuating her sentences with random bursts of happy laughter and responding to every question with an emphatic sincerity that is in some strange way both less real and more fabulously genuine than the way you or I talk. Danny, meanwhile, has sworn to be \"a fly on the wall\" during the interview. Quickly, it becomes obvious that the fly he's referring to is Jeff Goldblum in the Cronenberg film. Danny carefully hovers for the length of the brief, cheerfully uneventful conversation, either in fear for his life, in fear for hers, or maybe, some complex combination of the two:\nSeattle Weekly: So, is this a mini-tour?\nLiza Minnelli: Yeah, we're playing\u2014how many dates, Danny?\nDanny: There's a total of seven dates right now.\nMinnelli: I haven't been out West for a while, and I wanted to come back and do that.\nDanny: Yes, exactly.\nMinnelli: Yes!\nTo be honest, I'm surprised to hear Liza is even coming. Everybody knows she's been through a lot of late; hell, \"been through a lot\" has been her lot throughout four decades of giving her all. Performers are a dime a dozen now, but what they do doesn't involve the same kind of sweat it did back when Liza was learning her game, when people made their whole lives about entertaining, whole lives that seemed outrageously larger than the ones the rest of us were living\u2014a bit of engaging fantasy that reality TV has pummeled into oblivion. You're supposed to be jaded and ironic now when you talk about such people. But ladies like Liza have all my respect for what must be exhausting self-awareness.\nI wonder out loud if she ever feels like, Hell, I've had it\u2014I don't want to do this anymore.\nShe sounds honestly horrified.\n\"No!\" she gasps, also a bit amused at the absurdity of such an idea. \"No, I've never felt that in my life! The music is such fun, and the acting within the music\u2014and the rapport with an audience. It's . . . an art, sort of. I don't mean to sound stuck-up, but it's a craft I learned when I was 14, 15, 16, and . . . how can I explain it? It's just what I do.\" She roars with laughter.\nDanny interjects. \"It's what you do, and it's what you do fabulously!\"\n\"Thank you,\" Liza responds demurely.\nAnyway. It must be odd, I say, to be renowned as a live entertainer in an age when people can get their 15 minutes of fame on Survivor.\n\"Well, if that's true, I've had the longest 15 minutes in the world, I'll tell ya!\" she hoots.\nBut doesn't she worry about keeping up with the all changes in the industry?\n\"I don't, really, no,\" she says. \"But, you know, when you think about it, I'm a performing artist who's never had a hit record. There aren't any others. People have a hit record, then they go out and perform. I'm an entertainer.\"\nWhat has she noticed that's different now about entertainment?\n\"I think it's braver now,\" she says. \"I think you can do things and say things onstage, and sing songs about things, that you couldn't [before]. But, you know, I've always just done it the way I've always done it, which is, I find the song, I find the character. I write a little background for her: What kind of clothes does she wear? What is her kitchen like? Does she have decals on the fridge? And it's very detailed so that I totally inhabit the character.\"\nIs there anything she'd like to do that she hasn't done yet?\n\"Take a nap!\" she howls.\n\"Isn't that the truth?!\" agrees Danny. \"Take a long nap!

She's telling me she'll be singing mostly her signature tunes in her Seattle show, but that she'll also throw in a few surprises.\nTo even get to this point, I've had to promise her people not to discuss alcohol, rehab, or The Ex-Husband That Dare Not Speak His Name. I've also had to allow her manager, Danny, to listen in on the conversation from his mobile phone to ensure that I'll adhere to those promises. I'm not thrilled with the ground rules, though I agree to them. Come on\u2014it's Liza Minnelli. I'm not gay enough to have all her albums, but I am certainly gay enough to want to start an article with \"I'm on the phone with Liza Minnelli.\"\nShe sounds exactly like you think she does\u2014warm, weird, gushing, grand, punctuating her sentences with random bursts of happy laughter and responding to every question with an emphatic sincerity that is in some strange way both less real and more fabulously genuine than the way you or I talk. Danny, meanwhile, has sworn to be \"a fly on the wall\" during the interview. Quickly, it becomes obvious that the fly he's referring to is Jeff Goldblum in the Cronenberg film. Danny carefully hovers for the length of the brief, cheerfully uneventful conversation, either in fear for his life, in fear for hers, or maybe, some complex combination of the two:\nSeattle Weekly: So, is this a mini-tour?\nLiza Minnelli: Yeah, we're playing\u2014how many dates, Danny?\nDanny: There's a total of seven dates right now.\nMinnelli: I haven't been out West for a while, and I wanted to come back and do that.\nDanny: Yes, exactly.\nMinnelli: Yes!\nTo be honest, I'm surprised to hear Liza is even coming. Everybody knows she's been through a lot of late; hell, \"been through a lot\" has been her lot throughout four decades of giving her all. Performers are a dime a dozen now, but what they do doesn't involve the same kind of sweat it did back when Liza was learning her game, when people made their whole lives about entertaining, whole lives that seemed outrageously larger than the ones the rest of us were living\u2014a bit of engaging fantasy that reality TV has pummeled into oblivion. You're supposed to be jaded and ironic now when you talk about such people. But ladies like Liza have all my respect for what must be exhausting self-awareness.\nI wonder out loud if she ever feels like, Hell, I've had it\u2014I don't want to do this anymore.\nShe sounds honestly horrified.\n\"No!\" she gasps, also a bit amused at the absurdity of such an idea. \"No, I've never felt that in my life! The music is such fun, and the acting within the music\u2014and the rapport with an audience. It's . . . an art, sort of. I don't mean to sound stuck-up, but it's a craft I learned when I was 14, 15, 16, and . . . how can I explain it? It's just what I do.\" She roars with laughter.\nDanny interjects. \"It's what you do, and it's what you do fabulously!\"\n\"Thank you,\" Liza responds demurely.\nAnyway. It must be odd, I say, to be renowned as a live entertainer in an age when people can get their 15 minutes of fame on Survivor.\n\"Well, if that's true, I've had the longest 15 minutes in the world, I'll tell ya!\" she hoots.\nBut doesn't she worry about keeping up with the all changes in the industry?\n\"I don't, really, no,\" she says. \"But, you know, when you think about it, I'm a performing artist who's never had a hit record. There aren't any others. People have a hit record, then they go out and perform. I'm an entertainer.\"\nWhat has she noticed that's different now about entertainment?\n\"I think it's braver now,\" she says. \"I think you can do things and say things onstage, and sing songs about things, that you couldn't [before]. But, you know, I've always just done it the way I've always done it, which is, I find the song, I find the character. I write a little background for her: What kind of clothes does she wear? What is her kitchen like? Does she have decals on the fridge? And it's very detailed so that I totally inhabit the character.\"\nIs there anything she'd like to do that she hasn't done yet?\n\"Take a nap!\" she howls.\n\"Isn't that the truth?!\" agrees Danny. \"Take a long nap! We all want to take a nap!\"\nShe rather charmingly admits that she's spent her entire career wondering if she was ever going to get hired again.\n\"Really?\" I say. \"What did you think after winning the Oscar for Cabaret?\"\n\"I thought, 'This is never gonna happen again,'\" she swears, the laughter returning. \"But you have humor about it.

{"context":"Holiday Lets. Peering through the misty windows on the top deck of the bus from Shanklin to Ventnor on the Isle of Wight, trying to make out the sea between the wind-swept trees and the pretty thatched cottages on a cold damp May day.\nThis is how Mark Baker (53) recalls the moment when he first began to seriously think about investing in a holiday let.\n\u201cWe\u2019d had a terrible holiday weather-wise earlier on in the year and we were running out of indoor activities to do with the kids and that\u2019s when we decided to catch the bus and do a tour of the Island,\u201c says Mark, an IT manager from Chobham in Surrey. \u201cMy mind had begun to wander about retirement as I was looking at the houses \u2013 I know it\u2019s still a few years off but I do need to start planning for the future. I can\u2019t see myself living on the Island permanently when I retire but yet I am pulled to this beautiful place.\n\u201cThat\u2019s when I thought about holiday homes and Brexit \u2013 my feeling is that more people may start holidaying in this country especially if the pound does become weaker against the Euro. To me a buy-to-let holiday investment makes sense and also I can see us coming over here more often as a family.\u201d\nInvestors such as Mark are becoming increasingly attracted to the holiday buy-to-let market not only because of Brexit but also possibly because of new tax rules, lending criteria and the success of service accommodation and Airbnb, believes Lee from OnPoint Mortgages.\n\u201cWe have found that there has certainly been more of an interest in the buy-to-let holiday market recently. This may also be because of the Pridential Regulation Authority enforcing stricter lending requirements on buy-to-let loans, and also new taxes on rental revenue.\u201d\nWith a holiday-let you can still offset your full mortgage interest repayments against tax.\n\u201cUnder HM Revenue & Customs rules, the property must be available for letting for at least 210 days in the year and be let for at least 105 days. But unlike conventional buy-to-lets, you can also use your holiday home for as much as 20 weeks a year.\n\u201cThere are other benefits too such as deducting the cost of doing up a property from your pre-tax profits and you don\u2019t have to pay council tax on the property. With a buy-to-let holiday home you can also avoid local business rates.\u201d\nLee says that most buy-to-let lenders do not consider holiday lets because the property will not be let on an assured shorthold tenancy of between six and 12 months. OnPoint mortgages does, however, offer buy-let-mortgage products through lenders like Principality Building Society and Leeds Building Society.\n\u201cBefore considering a holiday home, it\u2019s important to to take into account factors such as the type of market you are aiming at and how practical it is physically getting to the property. If you are going to be doing the maintenance yourself consider whether you would be happy to drive for several hours to get to your property, spend all the weekend doing the decorating and then drive all the way back home, ready for work the next day.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to maintain the property yourself, you may want to find a local maintenance company to look after the it and also a cleaner who could come in on change-over days.\n\u201cYou will need to think about how you are going to market your property, such as through your own website or use a holiday lettings specialist.\u201d\nLee also advises to look for areas which are being invested in, such as the development of new flats and shops.\nFor would-be investor Mark, he is now considering different properties on the south Island as possible holiday-lets.\n\u201cWe\u2019re having fun looking at properties and I can\u2019t wait to have more holidays here!\u201d\nOnPoint Mortgages offers a range of mortgages including for those looking to enter the buy-to-let holiday market.\nPrincipality\nLeeds Building Society.","question":"What are some of the benefits of investing in a holiday-let property according to Mark Baker and Lee from OnPoint Mortgages?","answer":"Some of the benefits of investing in a holiday-let property include the ability to offset full mortgage interest repayments against tax, deducting the cost of doing up a property from pre-tax profits, and avoiding council tax and local business rates.

To me a buy-to-let holiday investment makes sense and also I can see us coming over here more often as a family.\u201d\nInvestors such as Mark are becoming increasingly attracted to the holiday buy-to-let market not only because of Brexit but also possibly because of new tax rules, lending criteria and the success of service accommodation and Airbnb, believes Lee from OnPoint Mortgages.\n\u201cWe have found that there has certainly been more of an interest in the buy-to-let holiday market recently. This may also be because of the Pridential Regulation Authority enforcing stricter lending requirements on buy-to-let loans, and also new taxes on rental revenue.\u201d\nWith a holiday-let you can still offset your full mortgage interest repayments against tax.\n\u201cUnder HM Revenue & Customs rules, the property must be available for letting for at least 210 days in the year and be let for at least 105 days. But unlike conventional buy-to-lets, you can also use your holiday home for as much as 20 weeks a year.\n\u201cThere are other benefits too such as deducting the cost of doing up a property from your pre-tax profits and you don\u2019t have to pay council tax on the property. With a buy-to-let holiday home you can also avoid local business rates.\u201d\nLee says that most buy-to-let lenders do not consider holiday lets because the property will not be let on an assured shorthold tenancy of between six and 12 months. OnPoint mortgages does, however, offer buy-let-mortgage products through lenders like Principality Building Society and Leeds Building Society.\n\u201cBefore considering a holiday home, it\u2019s important to to take into account factors such as the type of market you are aiming at and how practical it is physically getting to the property. If you are going to be doing the maintenance yourself consider whether you would be happy to drive for several hours to get to your property, spend all the weekend doing the decorating and then drive all the way back home, ready for work the next day.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to maintain the property yourself, you may want to find a local maintenance company to look after the it and also a cleaner who could come in on change-over days.\n\u201cYou will need to think about how you are going to market your property, such as through your own website or use a holiday lettings specialist.\u201d\nLee also advises to look for areas which are being invested in, such as the development of new flats and shops.\nFor would-be investor Mark, he is now considering different properties on the south Island as possible holiday-lets.\n\u201cWe\u2019re having fun looking at properties and I can\u2019t wait to have more holidays here!\u201d\nOnPoint Mortgages offers a range of mortgages including for those looking to enter the buy-to-let holiday market.\nPrincipality\nLeeds Building Society.\n"}

{"context":"Retail-isation of Barclays continues\nNews on Tuesday that Barclays had acquired the deposits, mortgages and business assets of consumer bank ING Direct UK, subject to regulatory approval, is consistent with the marked attempt to rebalance the group away from investment banking since retail banker Antony Jenkins took over as CEO.\nIFR Editor-at-large Keith Mullin\nThrough the acquisition, the bank picked up \u00a310.9bn (around US$17.5bn) of deposits at par along with a \u00a35.6bn mortgage book at a 3% discount.\nWith customer deposits of \u00a3113.9bn (US$182bn) as of June 30, the acquisition certainly isn\u2019t a game-changer for Barclays in a numbers sense.\nBut it comes a little more than a week after Jenkins stacked the group executive committee away from investment banking by splitting his old retail job into two and appointing both incumbents (Valerie Soranno Keating, CEO of Barclaycard; and Ashok Vaswani, former CEO of UK Retail and Business Banking now responsible for retail and business products and services) to the group ExCom.\nThat\u2019s certainly a radical transformation from Bob Diamond\u2019s ExCom, which had himself, Rich Ricci and Jerry del Missier from the investment bank in the inner circle. To my way of thinking, that was about right since the CIB division made and continues to make the majority of group profits.\nSince taking over, Jenkins had made broadly positive noises about the importance of the investment bank. But when he appointed Soranno Keating and Vaswani, he said the changes \u201creflect the importance of our retail businesses for Barclays and will make for a better balance between business and functional representation on the Executive Committee\u201d.\nStreamlining is one of those ominous words that are invariably used as a codeword for cutting\nI don\u2019t know about better balance: of the four global business-line heads on the 10-strong committee; two hail from the retail and business banking side (sharing 41.5% of revenues and 38% of pre-tax profits between them using interim 1H12 numbers); Tom Kalaris, CEO of Wealth & Investment Management, has less than 6% of revenues and 2.7% of profits, while Ricci is now the only representative of the corporate and investment bank, which generates close to 53% of revenues and 59% of profits.\nThat\u2019s not better balance; that\u2019s unbalanced and it certainly bodes ill for the investment bank in terms of Ricci\u2019s room for manoeuvre and ability to influence outcomes.\nStreamlining (read: cutting?)\nAt the same time, Ricci has been tasked with streamlining the corporate and investment bank. Streamlining is one of those ominous words that are invariably used as a codeword for cutting. Jenkins has already said he would exit activities that cause reputational risk. It\u2019s not clear specifically what he means by that \u2013 outside areas such as tax advisory, which has been widely criticised as facilitating large-scale tax avoidance. But cuts to the CIB are widely expected.\nAs for Ricci\u2019s shake-up of the CIB at the end of last week, it all seemed sensible enough. The big winners were Frenchman Eric Bommensath, head of the newly combined FICC and equities global markets businesses; and Tom King, most recently head of EMEA investment banking and co-head of global corporate finance and M&A.\nBommensath has taken over the global equities mantle formerly held by Jerry Donini as well as responsibility for global distribution, a role formerly held by Guglielmo Sartori di Borgoricco who is leaving the bank. How Bommensath structures the team beneath him will be key. A fixed-income man through and through \u2013 and a derivatives specialist at that \u2013 he\u2019ll need to put some decent firepower in place to make sure equities doesn\u2019t get crushed under the weight of the FICC platform.\nThat firepower won\u2019t be in the form of Donini, though, since the former head of equities shifted to become COO of the CIB in a move that kind of looks like one of those face-saving moves to avoid him having to report to Bommensath.\nInvestment banks have never been quite sure about regional heads in a globalised industry with tribal product alliances and alignments\nKing has been singled out for greatness. A 20-year Citigroup man and M&A rainmaker, he only joined Barclays in October 2009 but he was promoted into the waiting room of deputy head of IB before he takes over from Skip McGee in 2013 when McGee\u2019s day-job shifts to running CIB in the Americas away from his current slot as global head of investment banking. McGee, the former Lehman man, will keep his hat in the IB ring, though, by taking over as chairman.\nI wonder whether King will continue the streamlining of the investment banking group that McGee had kicked off in April when the corporate finance and M&A groups were merged under the trio of Tom King and Ros Stephenson (formerly co-heads of corporate finance) and Paul Parker, global head of M&A.\nThe merger made sense, as M&A execution was previously managed separately from corporate finance, which housed the industry sector and coverage teams.\nRicci has gone for a matrix of regional CEOs working alongside \u2013 or is that against? \u2013 global product heads. Investment banks have never been quite sure about regional heads in a globalised industry with tribal product alliances and alignments. (I also wonder about the sense of shifting McGee, a classic Wall Street investment banker, into an operational management role).\nThe rise of three regional CEOs will certainly engage more of Larry Wieseneck\u2019s time. In another April change, Wieseneck had moved out of his former role as head of Global Finance & Risk Solutions (ECM, DCM, leveraged finance and loans) to become head of strategy for the CIB in a role designed to ensure better alignment between businesses and regions.\nWith only four of the 13 people sitting on Ricci\u2019s CIB executive committee sporting functional business-line responsibilities versus three with regional responsibilities, it\u2019ll be an interesting balance. And to that point, having Larry Kantor sitting on the CIB ExCom as head of research with a direct line into Ricci is an anomaly relative to how other investment banks are structured.\nMost research heads fall under the global markets function. I wonder if that\u2019s the way Barclays will go as it continues to move forward. If so, that\u2019ll make the region\/product split 3-3.

{"context":"I have never been one for decorating my house, much to the chagrin of my mother who changes everything down to her curtains just about every season. When she moved back to Idaho several years ago, she stayed with my brother for a month and drove him nuts with all her ideas of what he needed\/should do to decorate his house. He still bitches about that. When James died and she saw my house for the first time, she offered some suggestions as to what I should do with it which I just ignored. For me, it is not so much the decor that matters but the feel. And my house feels like a home. Even with James gone, you can still feel the love when you walk in the door. (Once you get past the excitement of the boys, who you would think have never seen people before, that is).\nBut as part of the grief recovery process, I do feel it wouldn't hurt to add a few feminine touches here and there as part of that whole making the house \"mine\" instead of \"ours\" thing. My friend offered to help me with that, which I wisely did not tell my mother when she told me about this season's curtain scheme (blue, I think. I wasn't really listening). I would have gotten another lecture on how I need to get some pretty curtains. My mom is very big on her curtains. I don't want curtains-I have really cool wood blinds. Well, they look like wood anyway. My friend and I have looked at a couple of stores and I have pointed out a few things I like so she is keeping that in the back of her mind when she is out and about. She changes her house around from time to time and it always looks nice so I trust her. And yes, she does have curtains. But just on one window. She has blinds on the rest.\nToday on my way home, I stopped to get a birthday present for a friend and ended up getting a few things for myself. I really shouldn't have spent the money, but I justified it by everything I bought for myself being 20% off.\nThe first thing I got was a 12\" x 12\" square wall hanging with a seashell in the middle that says \"It's not what you look at that matters,\" down most of the left side and \"it's what you see.\" across most of the bottom. The shell looks like it is sitting on a antique yellow fabric square and the background behind it is different blues and browns. I am going to put this in my master bathroom, which is light blue with a darker marble looking blue counter. I have always thought some sort of nautical theme would work in there. My real reason for putting this in there, however, is so I will see it when I am getting ready in the morning and remind myself to really look at the person I am-not just the package I come in.\nThe second thing I got is a small plaque (about 9\" x 4\") that has a small blue butterfly in the lower left corner and a weird purple and blue flower with a green stem and leaves on the right side that says \"Life is a journey not a Destination\" on the left above the butterfly. I am not yet sure where this is going to go; I am thinking maybe by James' picture and his urn for now. It is a reminder to take the time to enjoy life now and not worry so much about getting to my future.\nThe last plaque I got is also small-about 5\" x 7\"- and has a daisy at the top and one of my new found favorite quotes in the middle: \"Life is not about waiting for the storm to pass, it's about learning to dance in the rain.\" It says Dance across the bottom. As any fan of Grey's Anatomy can tell you, sometimes you just have to dance it out. I am thinking about finding a spot here in the office for this one. This is my reminder to learn to find and appreciate the good in life even when it all seems to be going downhill.\nThere was one other plaque I was really tempted to get. It says \"I am not a fast cook and I am not a slow cook. I am a half-fast cook.\" I'm actually a pretty decent cook; I just thought that was really funny, especially when you say it out loud. The sale goes for another couple of days. I may have to go back for that.\nWith what little I have done so far, I have come to realize that no matter what I put on the walls or how many rooms I paint, James' essence will still be here and I am more than fine with that. It's what makes my house my home. But making my home a little more girly (I am SO not a girly girl) won't hurt anything and could actually be fun. But don't tell Mom I said that.\n1 comment:\nOh Heather, I LOVE to decorate!!! It is my Calling!! I wish so much we lived closer. We would have so much fun together. I would drag your but out of the house and to the local Michaels and show you a real craft store. Beautiful stuff. I make my own wreaths and decorations. A lot less now that I have two small children, but I try to do what I can. I enjoy decorating for Holidays, but this year will SUCK big time since it will be the first one without my sister.:( I don't know how I am going to get through Christmas without her, it was our favorite time of year. Once you start decorating the place to suit you, you will enjoy it more and more. You are so used to taking into consideration that you had a man around and not to make it too \"girly\", I think you lost track of the fun in it. You can decorate with out being girly.

{"context":"In the previous post I cited a tool for Photoshop I\u2019m working on \u2013 which is currently on its beta cycle, thanks to the people of Colortheory. Basically, it\u2019s a Photoshop script that lets you control separately both Amount and Radius for Unsharp Mask filter\u2019s Dark and Light halos: that is, you can apply USM 500% and 1.5px for Dark Halos and 300%, 0.9px for Light ones, tweaking sliders on a single GUI.\nBeing it a Script and not a Filter means that I have to drive Photoshop behind the scenes while you play with the interface (I don\u2019t have pixel access, it would require a programming knowledge exceeding my skills). In other words I must find a way to replicate with layers and filters that very effect; not only, the scheme update must be easy, because I can\u2019t afford the whole processing to be time consuming (otherwise the live-update performance of the tool would degrade).\nThat is to say: I won\u2019t follow the steps outlined in the post #1 of the series \u2013 producing two halo maps via Calculations, which would require a new calculation each time the user changes a single value. I need on-the-fly updatable parameters \u2013 I\u2019m afraid I need Smart Objects (SO). I\u2019m not particularly fond of SO \u2013 yet they provide Smart Filters (SF) which fit perfectly my requirements: SF are Filters applied non-permanently to a SO, i.e. you can decide to change their parameters anytime, or switch them on\/off.\nGiven this framework, how would you deal with SO and SF to split USM dark and light halos? There are at least two easy and intuitive ways that may came to your Photoshop-driven mind (they came to mine, too) \u2013 yet they\u2019re wrong; this post is just about this \u2013 how not to be fooled by appealing, easy paths.\nBlending modes: Darken \/ Lighten\nLet me use this exciting picture as an example:\nReminder: to convert a layer in a Smart Object, right click on the layer\u2019s name in the Layers palette and choose Convert to Smart Object. Be aware that if you right click on the layer\u2019s icon the option does not show (there must be good reasons that I miss for that). Alternatively, via menu: Layer \u2013 Smart Objects \u2013 Convert to Smart Object.\nThat said, if you duplicate the Background layer, convert it to SO, apply the Unsharp Mask Filter (USM, say 500% 10px, we\u2019ll always leave Threshold untouched) and set the SO blending mode to Lighten, this is what you get:\nSame concept but a different USM (500%, 30px) blended in Darken:\nSo what would we get if we mix the two?\nExactly what you would have expected \u2013 that\u2019s it, we\u2019re done splitting dark and light halos. With a caveat: what if we reverse the layer\u2019s order (Lighten top, Darken bottom)?\nUhm, it doesn\u2019t work anymore. So the trick is to keep the SO with the bigger USM Radius on top of the other \u2013 easy peasy.\nAlas, I should have been more careful, because I\u2019ve based a good deal of coding time on this paradigm (two SO in Darken \/ Lighten) just to discover that it is flawed.

The example I\u2019ve showed is misleading because as a test it is not exhaustive one: I\u2019ve changed one parameter only \u2013 the Radius, keeping the Amount full blast at 500% What happens for instance if I lower back the Amount of Dark halos to 100%? No matter how I would set the layers order, the result does not match my expectations:\nFirst row (Lighten on top) is obviously flawed because it erases the Darken effect \u2013 the dark halo is wrong. Middle row (Darken on top) is not correct too, because the light halo is slightly darkened by the dark halo: it\u2019s subtle because I\u2019ve used a low Amount. Check out the last row to compare them with the right effect. Back to square one.\nMultiple Smart Filters\nA single SO can support more than one SF (how many, frankly I don\u2019t know). A nice idea could be to apply two rounds of USM as SF to the same SO, fading them to Darken \/ Lighten. To fade a SF, click on the \u201clines-and-arrows\u201d icon at the right of the \u201cUnsharp Mask\u201d label of the Smart Filter.\nThere\u2019s a detail that prevent this one to work, though. SFs don\u2019t operate in parallel, but in sequence: that is, the first USM round acts on the original SO (as expected); the second USM round operates on the result of the first SF, i.e. upon an already sharpened version.

{"context":"- Fellowships\n- Resources\n- News Collaborative\n- Community\n- Blogs\n- Stories\n- Webinars\nHealth Challenges Faced by Midwestern Latino Communities: Lessons Learned from my Hunt Fellowship.\nJuly 05, 2012\nAt we have a motto that we like to shoot for the moon and see how far we get.\nOur Dennis A. Hunt Fellowship proposal was conceived and written in that spirit. We set out to write a trio of stories that all dealt with health issues faced by communities in the Midwest that had seen an increase in their Latino populations in the past decade. Our proposal said we would write stories about the degree to which federal agencies did or did not protect workers and their families in these areas, would look at access to health insurance in a couple of Chicago neighborhoods that had high numbers of Latino residents working full time, and would delve into the issue of trauma and resilience resulting from migrants\u2019 journeys north.\nFor the enforcement piece our objective was to build a that we would combine with census, jobs and environmental databases and food recalls. Our intention was to use what we built not only to create a new and unprecedented resource that we would share with our readers for their own searches, but also to identify companies that we would investigate in depth. The insurance piece drew on a national analysis we had done of data from the U.S. Census Bureau, and the trauma and resilience piece would be based in part on information and resources I had gained access to through my membership and participation in the and\nWe also sought to publish blog posts, videos, maps, court documents and others throughout the project, rather than wait until the end, and to forge collaborative relationships with other news publications.\nFinally, we wanted to look at these issues from a community-wide, rather than individual, perspective.\nOur project did not turn our precisely as we had planned.\nWe did indeed acquire the data mentioned above from OSHA and the EPA, and did blend this data with other data sources to which we had gained access. However, despite spending a lot of time on this effort, our enforcement story did not come from this route.\nInstead, we followed editor suggestion and of Wright County Egg in Galt, Iowa. In August 2010 the company was the subject of the largest egg recall in United States history. We and found that Jack DeCoster, the company owner, had a more than of e, a substantial portion of which involved his conscious policy of hiring undocumented Mexican workers for their work ethic and vulnerability. In addition to finding a staggering lack of communication between federal agencies, we also we were able to raise the question if these workers were the proverbial \u201ccanary in the coal mine.\u201d The implication was that more attention to undocumented workers\u2019 conditions and safety could perhaps have averted the later consumer disaster and recall.\nWe also used the occasion of a seeming enforcement success, the closure of a notoriously filthy and dangerous migrant worker camp in Rantoul, Illinois due to a collective effort from largely local enforcement agencies, advocates, service providers and media. that while the closure of Cherry Orchard was indeed an accomplishment and even a model for other communities, it did very little to change in any fundamental way the experience of those migrant workers.\nThe insurance story was a bit more straightforward.\nHere we learned and the many creative ways full-time workers use to meet their health care needs and other pressing financial responsibilities like the rent and food. For example, we met a woman who had to choose one night between eating and buying medicine for a sick child.\nShe bought the medicine.\nFor the trauma and resilience story, we traveled to Beardstown, Illinois, which in 2007 was the site of a massive immigration raid at the Cargill plant. We thought Beardstown made sense because the raid was a universally shared and searing event that still was very much alive in the hearts and heads of the town\u2019s Latino community. From that story we connected with Julio Flores, an El Salvadoran community activist who had to flee his country, but who had worked diligently in the town for 15 years to develop its sense of strength through cultural celebrations. y gave us new insight into communal trauma and the ways in which one can heal from it.\nWe did indeed publish as we went , and . We published mostly in Spanish, but had seven posts in English, too. Althoguh we reached out to a number of possible collaborators.

Hunt Fellowship proposal was conceived and written in that spirit. We set out to write a trio of stories that all dealt with health issues faced by communities in the Midwest that had seen an increase in their Latino populations in the past decade. Our proposal said we would write stories about the degree to which federal agencies did or did not protect workers and their families in these areas, would look at access to health insurance in a couple of Chicago neighborhoods that had high numbers of Latino residents working full time, and would delve into the issue of trauma and resilience resulting from migrants\u2019 journeys north.\nFor the enforcement piece our objective was to build a that we would combine with census, jobs and environmental databases and food recalls. Our intention was to use what we built not only to create a new and unprecedented resource that we would share with our readers for their own searches, but also to identify companies that we would investigate in depth. The insurance piece drew on a national analysis we had done of data from the U.S. Census Bureau, and the trauma and resilience piece would be based in part on information and resources I had gained access to through my membership and participation in the and\nWe also sought to publish blog posts, videos, maps, court documents and others throughout the project, rather than wait until the end, and to forge collaborative relationships with other news publications.\nFinally, we wanted to look at these issues from a community-wide, rather than individual, perspective.\nOur project did not turn our precisely as we had planned.\nWe did indeed acquire the data mentioned above from OSHA and the EPA, and did blend this data with other data sources to which we had gained access. However, despite spending a lot of time on this effort, our enforcement story did not come from this route.\nInstead, we followed editor suggestion and of Wright County Egg in Galt, Iowa. In August 2010 the company was the subject of the largest egg recall in United States history. We and found that Jack DeCoster, the company owner, had a more than of e, a substantial portion of which involved his conscious policy of hiring undocumented Mexican workers for their work ethic and vulnerability. In addition to finding a staggering lack of communication between federal agencies, we also we were able to raise the question if these workers were the proverbial \u201ccanary in the coal mine.\u201d The implication was that more attention to undocumented workers\u2019 conditions and safety could perhaps have averted the later consumer disaster and recall.\nWe also used the occasion of a seeming enforcement success, the closure of a notoriously filthy and dangerous migrant worker camp in Rantoul, Illinois due to a collective effort from largely local enforcement agencies, advocates, service providers and media. that while the closure of Cherry Orchard was indeed an accomplishment and even a model for other communities, it did very little to change in any fundamental way the experience of those migrant workers.\nThe insurance story was a bit more straightforward.\nHere we learned and the many creative ways full-time workers use to meet their health care needs and other pressing financial responsibilities like the rent and food. For example, we met a woman who had to choose one night between eating and buying medicine for a sick child.\nShe bought the medicine.\nFor the trauma and resilience story, we traveled to Beardstown, Illinois, which in 2007 was the site of a massive immigration raid at the Cargill plant. We thought Beardstown made sense because the raid was a universally shared and searing event that still was very much alive in the hearts and heads of the town\u2019s Latino community. From that story we connected with Julio Flores, an El Salvadoran community activist who had to flee his country, but who had worked diligently in the town for 15 years to develop its sense of strength through cultural celebrations. y gave us new insight into communal trauma and the ways in which one can heal from it.\nWe did indeed publish as we went , and . We published mostly in Spanish, but had seven posts in English, too. Althoguh we reached out to a number of possible collaborators.

{"context":"NBA Trade Rumors: Latest Buzz on Carmelo Anthony, Brandon Knight and MoreJuly 17, 2017\nThe 2017 edition of the NBA offseason has been an entertaining one. While it's often the NFL that commands the summer offseason, basketball has remained front and center ever since the end of the NBA Finals.\nThe offseason began with a stellar draft class and some headline-grabbing trades and has continued to shine throughout an entertaining summer league. Even as we enter the second half of July, media attention remains high thanks to the possibility of some more notable moves.\nMany of the biggest tradable players of the offseason\u2014like Chris Paul, Paul George and Jimmy Butler\u2014have already been moved. However, there are still some notable guys who could be traded. We're here to examine the latest trade buzz as the offseason continues.\nCarmelo Trade Still a Possibility\nCarmelo Anthony remains the most notable name on the trade market. He was the subject of trade rumors before Phil Jackson was ousted as team president, and he remains at the center of them even now. The reason for this is that Anthony is an aging veteran, and the New York Knicks are looking toward yet another rebuild.\nThe fact Anthony is set to earn $54 million over the next two seasons doesn't exactly help his value with the retooling Knicks either.\nHowever, ESPN's Ramona Shelburne and Adrian Wojnarowski reported last week that the Knicks were putting trade talks on hold. The team had been involved in talks with both the Houston Rockets and the Cleveland Cavaliers\u2014the two teams Anthony is interested in joining via trade.\nAnthony holds a no-trade clause in his current contract.\nWhile Shelburne and Wojnarowski reported that the Knicks are interested in getting Anthony to return to the team, this doesn't mean a trade won't eventually happen.

While it's often the NFL that commands the summer offseason, basketball has remained front and center ever since the end of the NBA Finals.\nThe offseason began with a stellar draft class and some headline-grabbing trades and has continued to shine throughout an entertaining summer league. Even as we enter the second half of July, media attention remains high thanks to the possibility of some more notable moves.\nMany of the biggest tradable players of the offseason\u2014like Chris Paul, Paul George and Jimmy Butler\u2014have already been moved. However, there are still some notable guys who could be traded. We're here to examine the latest trade buzz as the offseason continues.\nCarmelo Trade Still a Possibility\nCarmelo Anthony remains the most notable name on the trade market. He was the subject of trade rumors before Phil Jackson was ousted as team president, and he remains at the center of them even now. The reason for this is that Anthony is an aging veteran, and the New York Knicks are looking toward yet another rebuild.\nThe fact Anthony is set to earn $54 million over the next two seasons doesn't exactly help his value with the retooling Knicks either.\nHowever, ESPN's Ramona Shelburne and Adrian Wojnarowski reported last week that the Knicks were putting trade talks on hold. The team had been involved in talks with both the Houston Rockets and the Cleveland Cavaliers\u2014the two teams Anthony is interested in joining via trade.\nAnthony holds a no-trade clause in his current contract.\nWhile Shelburne and Wojnarowski reported that the Knicks are interested in getting Anthony to return to the team, this doesn't mean a trade won't eventually happen. In fact, per Wojnarowski, Anthony is counting on the Knicks to resume talks him, league sources said.\"\nThe one thing the Knicks may be able to rely on is the fact Anthony previously expressed his desire to remain in New York in order to be close to his son. It's not as if the team can sell him on championship aspirations.

{"context":"The life of a pro wrestler is a hectic one. Muscled up, often steroid-filled, testosterone-raging men who travel the globe on a regular basis can get a little grumpy from time-to-time. At times, these guys can lose their cool and get into altercations with each other. In part two of a new editorial series here at eWrestlingNews.com, \u201cBackstage Fight Stories,\u201d we\u2019re going to take a look at another infamous behind-the-scenes brawl that involved two well-known professional wrestlers.\nAs I get older and the business continues to move ahead, I\u2019m learning more and more that the fan base is filled with a lot of younger fans. I\u2019m learning that stories I\u2019ve heard, that I assume are common-knowledge to all wrestling fans, are actually brand new to this generation. So while you and I may remember these stories as if they happened yesterday, we have to understand that thousands upon thousands of younger fans have never heard of them. If you have, then enjoy reading about them again. If you haven\u2019t, strap on your seat belts because some of them will shock the hell out of you. Today, in part two of our \u201cBackstage Fight Stories\u201d series, we will take a look at Scott Steiner vs. Diamond Dallas Page.\nScott Carl Rechsteiner, who performed during his pro wrestling career as Scott Steiner, was a legitimate amateur wrestler before entering the \u201cprofessional\u201d level. Rechsteiner wrestled at 190 pounds for the University of Michigan, where he became a three-time Big 10 runner-up after finishing fifth in his freshman year in college. He later became a NCAA Division I All-American and placed sixth in the United States in his senior year.\nPage Joseph Falkinburg, who performed during his pro wrestling career as Diamond Dallas Page (DDP), was originally an aspiring basketball player. Fulkinburg played basketball at St. Joseph\u2019s High School (which is now known as Monsignor Donovan High School) during his freshman year on the junior varsity team, and on the varsity squad as a sophomore. Falkinburg later became a mainstay in the nightclub industry before becoming a full-fledged pro wrestler at an older age than most talents who enter the business.\nSteiner and Page both worked in WCW during the heyday of the infamous WWE vs. WCW \u201cMonday Night Wars.\u201d Things between the two reached a boiling point in 2001 when Kimberly Page, DDP\u2019s wife at the time, found an illegal substance backstage and allegedly went to WCW management, informing them that it belonged to Tammy \u201cSunny\u201d Sytch. Sytch denied the accusation and even offered to take a drug test on the spot \u2014 which she ended up passing. This is where things got interesting.\nApparently Steiner caught wind of what was happening and literally chased Kimberly out of the building. Subsequently, Kimberly would never appear on WCW television again.\nAt the following television taping, Steiner cut a shoot promo on Page, who at this point was fed up and felt the need to stand up for not only his wife, but himself as a man. Page ended up waiting for Steiner backstage after he cut the aforementioned televised promo, and this is where all hell broke loose.\nAs the story goes, DDP, who was waiting for Steiner behind the curtain, confronted the former NCAA Division I All-American wrestler as soon as he made his way backstage. The two allegedly exchanged some heated verbal insults before things got physical. Apparently the two ended up in a clinch, and depending on multiple versions of the story, DDP put a front-face-lock of sorts, or a guillotine choke by today\u2019s mixed-martial-arts standards, on the larger grappler. The two were supposedly separated, but unfortunately for DDP the situation didn\u2019t end there.\nAgain, there are a number of variations to the story, but apparently Steiner broke free from those holding him back at the time and allegedly went completely berserk. Page, who tried throwing a kick at Steiner, ended up on the ground as the result of a double-leg-dive, or a traditional amateur-style takedown from the man with the legitimate wrestling experience. Here\u2019s where things got ugly, and where details become a bit scarce.\nSteiner reportedly went for DDP\u2019s eyes. That\u2019s right, Steiner tried ripping DDP\u2019s eyeballs out of the socket, rendering the \u201cPeople\u2019s Champion\u201d at the time (Page was calling himself that before \u201cThe Rock\u201d was in WWE) blind. Going for the eyes in a legitimate fight is one of many tricks professional wrestlers were taught in the old days when instructed how to really \u201chandle yourself\u201d in a legitimate altercation. \u201cThe eyes are the groin of the face,\u201d as was once referenced as a joke on the hit-comedy television series \u201cThe Office.\u201d\nWhile it may have served as a joke for the documentary-style television series, truer words have never been spoken. Anyone who has taken a solid shot to the ball-bag knows \u2014 game over. At least temporarily. In this case, where several other muscled up bad asses were there to break things up, the game was over for good. DDP allegedly bit Steiner in an attempt to get \u201cThe Big Bad Booty Daddy\u201d off of him, and the two were once again separated.\nDDP, who had come off as a hero to his fellow WCW employees for standing up to someone who was perceived as a bully, and during the initial scuffle reportedly looked to be holding his own in an impressive fashion, was a mess. His face was apparently in bad shape, with obvious damage suffered during their brief exchanges. Page later claimed that his face resembled \u201cFreddy Krueger\u201d from the popular horror movie series, \u201cA Nightmare On Elm Street.\u201d\nFor those who would like to hear Diamond Dallas Page tell his version of the story, click here to listen to an excerpt from a radio interview where he spends about five minutes discussing the legitimate backstage fight with Steiner.\nSo there you have it.

{"context":"We've been living in a COVID world for more than 18 months now.

With our differences come different immune systems. This means the same virus can produce different signs and symptoms in different ways.\nA sign is something that's seen, such as a rash. A symptom is something that's felt, like a sore throat.\nThe way a virus causes illness is dependent on two key factors:\nviral factors include things like speed of replication, modes of transmission, and so on.

To ascertain this, we have to collect information from individual cases.\nIt's important to note this data is not always easy to collect or analyze to ensure there's no bias. For example, older people may have different symptoms to younger people, and collecting data from patients in a hospital may be different to patients at a GP clinic.\nSo what are the common signs and symptoms of the Delta variant?\nUsing a self-reporting system through a mobile app, data from the United Kingdom suggest the most common COVID symptoms may have changed from those we traditionally associated with the virus.\nThe reports don't take into account which COVID variant participants are infected with. But given Delta is predominating in the UK at present, it's a safe bet the symptoms we see here reflect the Delta variant.\n(The Conversation\/CC BY ND)\nWhile fever and cough have always been common COVID symptoms, and headache and sore throat have traditionally presented for some people, a runny nose was rarely reported in earlier data.

It may be because data were originally coming mainly from patients presenting to hospital who were therefore likely to be sicker.

At the same time, we need to remember the results haven't yet been fully analysed or stratified. That is, \"host factors\" such as age, gender, other illnesses, medications and so on haven't been accounted for, as they would in a rigorous clinical trial.\nAnd as is the case with all self-reported data, we have to acknowledge there may be some flaws in the results.\nDoes vaccination affect the symptoms?\nAlthough new viral variants can compromise the effectiveness of vaccines, for Delta, the vaccines available in Australia (Pfizer and AstraZeneca) still appear to offer good protection against symptomatic COVID-19 after two doses.\nImportantly, both vaccines have been shown to offer greater than 90 percent protection from severe disease requiring hospital treatment.\nA recent \"superspreader\" event in New South Wales highlighted the importance of vaccination. Of 30 people who attended this birthday party, reports indicated none of the 24 people who became infected with the Delta variant had been vaccinated.

People have become more complacent with social distancing, seasons change, vaccination rates vary - all these factors affect the data.\nBut scientists are becoming more confident the Delta variant represents a more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 strain.\nAs we face another COVID battle in Australia we're reminded the war against COVID is not over and we all have a role to play.

{"context":"Newly passed legislation could give Holbrook some leverage in deciding a new water distribution source.\nTown administrator William Phelan told the board of selectmen on Aug. 12 that the state environmental bond bill includes a provision that would match dollar-for-dollar the cost of a $50 million new Tri-Town water treatment plant or match Holbrook's tie-in fee to the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) system.\nAccording to Phelan, Gov.

{"context":"1. Alba Botanica Exfoliating Scrub\nThis is marketed as a facial exfoliation product, however I actually use it for my feet. I have sensitive skin, and it was causing my face to break out. I am phasing it out of my shower because it leaves large chunks of gooey-sand that dry and stick to the tub. I never seem to notice them when I\u2019m showering, but whenever my daughters take a bath or I\u2019m cleaning the bathtub, I really notice how much this product builds up in the tubs basin and on the ledges.\n2. Aveno\u2019s Simply Radiant\nThis product is amazing. It smells wonderful, leaves my face glowing, soft, and best of all feeling healthy. I usually apply this after my facial cleanse (#3). My face has never felt better!\n3. Nuetrogena\u2019s Stress Releif Acne Scrub\nI have very sensitive skin and it\u2019s been hard to find a cleanser that actually gets the job done. When things get really stressful my face tends to break out, and this scrub has been remarkable. It has stopped the breakouts and cleared up any spots of acne that have already appeared. I follow it up with a skin toner (#2).\n4. Up&Up\u2019s Soy Shave gel\nThis product is found exclusively at Target. You\u2019ll hear me talk about the Up&Up brand a lot because I\u2019m a big fan of it. They are low cost good quality products. This particular product leaves my skin smooth with a nice natural scent to follow.\n5. Yardly\u2019s Mango Shower Gel\nI give this a thumbs down because while it does smell great, I am phasing it out of my shower. It doesn\u2019t really leave a fresh feeling or fragrance behind, but rather lathers and disappears completely leaving the experience completely unmemorable. I\u2019m still scouting for that perfect body wash that leaves my skin feeling soft and smelling good!\n6. Garnier Fructis\u2019s Sleek and Shine Shampoo and Conditioner\nI have used this product for years. It smells wonderful, leaves my hair feeling healthy and strong, and best of all it doesn\u2019t give you that waxy buildup that other products do but does give you all the shine!\n7. Massagers\nThis are a good add to any shower, especially after a long day. Warm water and something to work out the kinks in your lower back and shoulders is just what the doctor ordered! Can usually find these in your bath isle at your local retail chains.\n8. Exfoliating Glove\nThese are wonderful to use for your feet, elbows, knees, and any other place you get dry skin. I usually apply some body wash and work it into a lather using this glove. Goodbye dead skin, hello good feelings!\n9. Munckin tub cup\nThis handy tub-cup is made of a very flexible rubber. This is super helpful for when you need to rinse out the shampoo from your kids hair (press the cup to their forehead and it bends to ensure water will not get into their eyes). I store mine upside down from my shower caddy to ensure it dries and does not collect mildew and standing water.\n10. Crayola color-changing loufas\nThis is a very fun way to get your kids excited about lathering away their dirty day. These loufas change color when they heat up (from pink to white). It\u2019s fun to put a little magic into bath-time.","question":"Why is the user phasing out the Alba Botanica Exfoliating Scrub from their shower routine?","answer":"The user is phasing out the Alba Botanica Exfoliating Scrub because it leaves large chunks of gooey-sand that dry and stick to the tub, causing a build-up in the tub's basin and on the ledges.","question_with_prompt":"Why is the user phasing out the Alba Botanica Exfoliating Scrub from their shower routine?\n","target_context":"1.

I\u2019m still scouting for that perfect body wash that leaves my skin feeling soft and smelling good!\n6. Garnier Fructis\u2019s Sleek and Shine Shampoo and Conditioner\nI have used this product for years. It smells wonderful, leaves my hair feeling healthy and strong, and best of all it doesn\u2019t give you that waxy buildup that other products do but does give you all the shine!\n7. Massagers\nThis are a good add to any shower, especially after a long day. Warm water and something to work out the kinks in your lower back and shoulders is just what the doctor ordered! Can usually find these in your bath isle at your local retail chains.\n8. Exfoliating Glove\nThese are wonderful to use for your feet, elbows, knees, and any other place you get dry skin. I usually apply some body wash and work it into a lather using this glove. Goodbye dead skin, hello good feelings!\n9. Munckin tub cup\nThis handy tub-cup is made of a very flexible rubber. This is super helpful for when you need to rinse out the shampoo from your kids hair (press the cup to their forehead and it bends to ensure water will not get into their eyes). I store mine upside down from my shower caddy to ensure it dries and does not collect mildew and standing water.\n10. Crayola color-changing loufas\nThis is a very fun way to get your kids excited about lathering away their dirty day. These loufas change color when they heat up (from pink to white). It\u2019s fun to put a little magic into bath-time.\n"}
{"context":"[Jenial Thanks to Janine Mendes-Franco, of Global Voices Online, for selecting two posts, about Our rising emigration and the changes in Our inner voice.]\nWhat kind of voter movement would make the biggest difference in Our deteriorating PanoRama?\nFirst, what would a voter movement be and is one needed? Taking the last question first: crime up, murders way up, education dropping even more than its Third World rating would predict, corruption up, jobs down, economy tanking, government bond debt limit reached, government credit rating dropping, stupid political leaders playing kissie-assie with each other, emigration rising... If anyone thinks the current sewage dump of \"\"\"leaders\"\"\" is going to change their thieving, me-first bullshit, then they are retarded and should not vote.\nAs for why a voter movement and not some other \"peaceful\" process: short of a violent overthrow and non-existent recall solutions, the simplest and most direct path to change Our (non)government is through the elections. Since every electoral office is up for grabs every 4 years, the only real chance We have to make minimal or wholesale changes is at the ballot box.\nMoving on. The voter movement I envision would obviously have to cross party lines, galvanize abut 350,000 - 425,000 votes and focus on taking out entrenched Fools.\nWhy?\n1) Cross party lines: The average voter wants to feel that his or her vote \"wins\" in some way. Appealing to only one party or ideology group will cause the average voter (species name: Voticus ignoramus) to fear that their vote will \"be wasted.\" Of course, they don't see that voting for anyone already elected is \"wasting\" their vote because those already in power are parasites living off Our indifference.\n2) Galvanize 350,000-425,000 voters: The average election in Puerto Rico has about an 85% turnout and that means about 1.8 million votes cast. Twenty percent of that number is 360,000, a substantial number that will cause all Fools to take the voter movement extremely seriously. Especially when the movement focuses on point 3...\n3) Taking out entrenched Fools: There are folks in Our government that have the morals of an opium fiend with the willies, the ethical standards of a child-molesting priest and the intellectual development of week-old gumbo. Yet these scumbuckets are making decisions about Our economy (crashing), Our education (crashed), Our taxes (crushing) and thus Our future (crushed.) For that privilege, We are paying many of them salary and benefit packages that are simply ridiculous when compared to Our averages: mayors making over $100,000 a year, legislators making over $110,000, Cabinet officials over $190,000 and even support staff is making over $80,000. And what about consultants making over $125,000 on each of two or three \"legitimate\" contracts?\nBy attacking the incumbents, the voter movement automatically becomes one \"of change, for change.\" Rather than attack all the incumbents, a series of targets are selected, primarily from the legislature. (Folks, I don't capitalize words for institutions I don't have at least a modicum of respect.) To make the biggest change, targets from each major party are selected and the criteria are simple: Those holding key legislative positions (president, vicepresident, speaker of each chamber, etc.) and those with the longest incumbencies (long-term parasites.)\nA quick scan means that media tumors and crap merchants like Jenniffer \"Gluttonny\" Gonz\u00e1lez and Tom\u00e1s \"Mad Dog\" Rivera would be targeted alongside commonwealth party tapeworms like Antonio \"You Haven't Caught Me\" Fas and Jos\u00e9 \"I Look Up to Tapeworms\" Varela. As the statehood party currently controls the legislature, there will be more names from that party than from the other, but that's how these changes work: by targeting those who have the most to lose.\nIn that sense, all legislators elected \"by accumulation,\" i.e., not tied to any senatorial or representational district, are the best targets, for they are often \"\"\"party leaders\"\"\" who use their \"\"widespread mandate\"\"\" to fuck Us. (Notice the absolute lack of quotation marks around fuck Us. Twice.)\nAlso amongst the targets are certain mayors, who have become entrenched to the point of idiocy. Two examples are Carlos \"I'm A Businessman Like the Mafia Is a Brotherhood\" M\u00e9ndez, of Aguadilla and Jos\u00e9 \"City Hall Is My Closet\" Rodr\u00edguez, of Mayag\u00fcez. Why them? because they've been in that chair for over 12 years; their time is past, if it ever was.\nThe voter movement would focus on kicking out incumbents, targeting them with direct questions, deep analysis of their shortcomings and raising awareness of how utterly useless these high-profile, long-squatting pisspots are. Rather than trying to change the entire political system, the voter movement would narrow its focus to a true leverage position: shaking the foundation of the most ambitious and entrenched.\nNothing strikes more fear into the heart of a Fool--more so than an F.B.I. badge--than a voter group that the Fool cannot buy. A voter movement aimed at knocking off incumbents, that crosses party lines in order to make changes happen, is a powerful force: when that force is applied well, it makes change inevitable.\nAnd once the voter movement proves its worth, it need only target other high-profile, long-squatting smegmacups to make them pay attention to Us. Because that's the whole point of this voter movement: to make the Fools understand that they work for Us and that We hold the power, not them.\nA name?

{"context":"Jeff Larson defends use of RNC funds [INTERVIEW]\nBy Andy Mannix and Mike Mullen\nIn 2008, St. Paul hosted the Republican National Convention. Republican strategist Jeff Larson was the CEO and treasurer of the host committee, which raised $65 million prior to the four-day event (Read this week's feature, RNC Piggy Bank). After the convention left town and its debts were paid, the host committee still had a surplus of more than $7 million.\nThough the bulk would go to charity, a number of individuals and companies continued to receive payments from the surplus years after the convention. Several campaign finance experts who analyzed the expenditure reports for City Pages say the pattern of spending so long after the convention is abnormal, and deserves an explanation.\nFor this we went to Larson, the man in charge. Larson declined to be interviewed over the phone, but agreed to answer questions via e-mail. Larson did not respond to questions about payments made to specific individuals after the convention. Here's an abbreviated version of what he would tell us:\nCity Pages: Can you start by explaining who selected you to be CEO of the 2008 Republican National Convention Host Committee? Why were you interested in taking this job?\nJeff Larson: I believed the Twin Cities needed a shot in the arm. It had been a long time since the Minneapolis St Paul had hosted anything nearly as large as the National Convention. You would have to go back to the Super Bowl in 1991 since we were on the national stage...\n...Since it was the Republican Convention that decided to come here, and since the Host Committee needed someone who knew the community and knew the workings of the RNC, they asked me to take this position. I did it to help ensure Minneapolis Saint Paul put on a world-class Convention that put us on the map with other convention cities like Chicago, Boston, New York, New Orleans, Denver and Los Angeles. We did exactly that thanks to our Board, our team, and the community.\nCP: It's been more than two years now since the convention, and the host committee still exists. Why has the committee not closed yet?\nJL: The short answer is the Federal Elections Commission had not allowed us to do so\nCP: You told National Journal reporter Ed Pound in 2008 that your position as CEO of the committee was unpaid. Why?\nJL: I was brought on as the Chief Executive Officer of the Host Committee on July 1, 2007. According to the written Consulting Agreement, I could be reimbursed for expenses but draw no consulting fee or payment. I was eligible for a discretionary bonus at the conclusion of the convention based on the Board's view of how well I achieved certain goals and if there was any money left over.\nOn July 21, 2009, the Board of Directors held an Executive Session to discuss my performance as Chief Executive Officer of the Host Committee. At that time, I had served as the CEO for over 2 years.

We provide our clients with the personalized representation they need to assert their rights and protect their interests.\nA job-related accident or illness can leave you disabled and unable to financially support your family and yourself. Massachusetts, however, provides a way for injured workers to receive certain benefits if they are hurt in the course of their employment. Under the state Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, all employers in the state must carry this no-fault insurance coverage. It provides medical, wage, job retraining, and other benefits to employees who were harmed or became sick as a result of their work.\nTo qualify for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, your injury or illness must be job-related and cause you to miss at least five days of work. Your employer\u2019s insurer will review your claim to determine your eligibility. If you qualify, you will receive compensation for reasonable and necessary medical costs associated with your injuries, partial wage compensation, and possibly other benefits.\nThe amount of financial assistance you receive, and the duration, will depend on how much your accident or illness disabled you.

For instance, it may dispute your eligibility, the extent of your injury or illness, or your need for certain medical care. It may also approve your claim and then later ask the Department of Industrial Accidents (DIA) to reduce your benefits. If the insurer denies or wants to modify your benefits, you can dispute the decision by appealing to the DIA. The dispute process involves various stages, including a meeting with a DIA conciliator and hearings before an administrative judge. You will need to present medical evidence to support your position. Our attorneys have handled numerous workers\u2019 compensation claims. We can advise and represent you if your claim has been denied or if the insurer wants to modify your benefits.\nAt Pulgini & Norton, we advise home owners, buyers, sellers, and lenders in a broad range of real estate matters.

We have more than 40 years of combined experience advising home owners and employees. We provide our clients with the personalized representation they need to assert their rights and protect their interests.\nA job-related accident or illness can leave you disabled and unable to financially support your family and yourself. Massachusetts, however, provides a way for injured workers to receive certain benefits if they are hurt in the course of their employment. Under the state Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, all employers in the state must carry this no-fault insurance coverage. It provides medical, wage, job retraining, and other benefits to employees who were harmed or became sick as a result of their work.\nTo qualify for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, your injury or illness must be job-related and cause you to miss at least five days of work. Your employer\u2019s insurer will review your claim to determine your eligibility. If you qualify, you will receive compensation for reasonable and necessary medical costs associated with your injuries, partial wage compensation, and possibly other benefits.\nThe amount of financial assistance you receive, and the duration, will depend on how much your accident or illness disabled you. The main categories are:\nYour employer\u2019s insurer may try to deny your claim for a number of reasons. For instance, it may dispute your eligibility, the extent of your injury or illness, or your need for certain medical care. It may also approve your claim and then later ask the Department of Industrial Accidents (DIA) to reduce your benefits. If the insurer denies or wants to modify your benefits, you can dispute the decision by appealing to the DIA. The dispute process involves various stages, including a meeting with a DIA conciliator and hearings before an administrative judge. You will need to present medical evidence to support your position. Our attorneys have handled numerous workers\u2019 compensation claims. We can advise and represent you if your claim has been denied or if the insurer wants to modify your benefits.\nAt Pulgini & Norton, we advise home owners, buyers, sellers, and lenders in a broad range of real estate matters. We carefully review and negotiate pivotal documents in the purchase and sale process. Whether you are a buyer or seller, we will negotiate terms that protect your interests while helping you resolve any issues that arise along the way. We can oversee the closing to ensure that documents are properly drafted, signed, and recorded, and that funds are distributed in a timely manner.\nWe also provide counseling in financing matters. If you need to finance or refinance a mortgage, we can discuss how some provisions, such as a changing interest rate, balloon payment, or other term, can affect your ownership and ability to sell the property in the future.

{"context":"Select HTC phones to get unlocked bootloaders starting in August\nOwners of the global HTC Sensation, the HTC Evo 3D for Sprint and the HTC Sensation 4G for T-Mobile will be the first to get the two-part update starting in August. The first part of the update is considered a maintenance release which more or less will prepare each device for the major update.\nPart two will be the actual unlocking tool which will finish sometime in September, making this update a little bit of a dragged out process. The biggest hurdle of course is what the carriers will do. Will Sprint and T-Mobile allow devices with unlocked bootloaders on their network? That remains to be seen.\nHTC not only made it clear that other devices will receive this update sometime down the road, but we can all expect to see devices shipping with unlocked bootloaders in the near future.

Its specialized form of hyaluronic acid ensures that it improves both the appearance and the quality of treated skin, leaving patients with incredible, long-lasting results. It has also been proven to stimulate the production of collagen and elastin, increasing overall skin health.\nThis formula contains Tri-hyal hyaluronic acid, giving it added smoothing potential.

These include pregnant and breastfeeding women; individuals with autoimmune or bleeding disorders; patients with a hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients in this formulation; and patients who are prone to keloid scarring.\nAfter injection, many patients experience some mild swelling, bruising, redness, and irritation at the treatment site.

{"context":"Wedding in Trentino in Northern Italy Sarah and Alessandro\u2019s wedding in Trentino in Northern Italy was one of those epic parties where their personalities, individual style and taste could be seen and felt throughout every moment of the day. Having tied the knot in an official capacity a few years earlier, they finally got around to bringing their family and friends from 12 different countries together in Ale\u2019s hometown for a much anticipated and longed for celebration. W&E Photographie did a magnificent job and really captured the essence of what this amazing duo are all about. W&E Photographie \u201cSarah is Brazilian. Ale is Italian. They met in Denmark. Soon after they moved to Norway \u2013 Troms\u00f8, in the very tip, top of Norway to be exact. Since their family and friends were all over the world they wanted a wedding where they could all celebrate together. They were more than happy to wait a few years if that\u2019s what it took to get everyone in one place. Sarah & Ale are the kind of people you just want to be around. The wedding took place in an open field overlooking the foothills of the Italian Alps. This part of Italy is made up of hundreds of tiny towns connected by winding mountain roads. It\u2019s definitely Italy, but the German-Swiss influence can\u2019t be missed. It\u2019s a beautiful blend of cultures and an incredibly charming part of Italy. In true Italian form, there was a vintage vespa, free-flowing wine & limoncello, and once evening arrived, customary games played by the bride & groom. The couple went for a relaxed and vintage feel for their attire. Sarah and Ale also had a few lovely details made by family and friends to be enjoyed at the reception tucked away in the woods. We loved being a part of a real Italian wedding \u2013 it was such an incredible experience.\u201d From Sarah and Ale Our initial idea was to have two wedding parties: one in Italy where Ale comes from and another in Brazil I am from but we were worried that would divide the family and the friends we have from all over the world because they would have to decide which one of the two parties to go. So we agreed that it would be best to have one single party and northern Italy was chosen. Ale\u2019s family has a field with a breathtaking view that perfectly matched our vision for the kind of ceremony we wanted, a very relaxed, laid back and family oriented celebration on the mountains of Ale\u2019s childhood. The reception took place in a wooden house in a forest close to the field and it was everything we were hoping for. We didn\u2019t have a planner or any type of professionals involved (except for our photographers) and so everything was made with the help of friends and family and it couldn\u2019t have been better. Italian weddings have a few unique traditions and we wanted to incorporate some of them into our own day.

The ceremony was unique as it was held in an open field overlooking the Italian Alps and the reception was in a wooden house in a forest close to the field. They incorporated Italian wedding traditions into their ceremony, such as the groom holding the bouquet and giving it to the bride when she reaches the top of the aisle, and the Italian friends preparing games and pranks for the newlywed couple.","question_with_prompt":"Where did Sarah and Alessandro's wedding take place and what was unique about their ceremony?\n","target_context":"Wedding in Trentino in Northern Italy Sarah and Alessandro\u2019s wedding in Trentino in Northern Italy was one of those epic parties where their personalities, individual style and taste could be seen and felt throughout every moment of the day. Having tied the knot in an official capacity a few years earlier, they finally got around to bringing their family and friends from 12 different countries together in Ale\u2019s hometown for a much anticipated and longed for celebration. W&E Photographie did a magnificent job and really captured the essence of what this amazing duo are all about. W&E Photographie \u201cSarah is Brazilian. Ale is Italian. They met in Denmark. Soon after they moved to Norway \u2013 Troms\u00f8, in the very tip, top of Norway to be exact. Since their family and friends were all over the world they wanted a wedding where they could all celebrate together. They were more than happy to wait a few years if that\u2019s what it took to get everyone in one place. Sarah & Ale are the kind of people you just want to be around. The wedding took place in an open field overlooking the foothills of the Italian Alps. This part of Italy is made up of hundreds of tiny towns connected by winding mountain roads. It\u2019s definitely Italy, but the German-Swiss influence can\u2019t be missed. It\u2019s a beautiful blend of cultures and an incredibly charming part of Italy. In true Italian form, there was a vintage vespa, free-flowing wine & limoncello, and once evening arrived, customary games played by the bride & groom. The couple went for a relaxed and vintage feel for their attire. Sarah and Ale also had a few lovely details made by family and friends to be enjoyed at the reception tucked away in the woods. We loved being a part of a real Italian wedding \u2013 it was such an incredible experience.\u201d From Sarah and Ale Our initial idea was to have two wedding parties: one in Italy where Ale comes from and another in Brazil I am from but we were worried that would divide the family and the friends we have from all over the world because they would have to decide which one of the two parties to go. So we agreed that it would be best to have one single party and northern Italy was chosen. Ale\u2019s family has a field with a breathtaking view that perfectly matched our vision for the kind of ceremony we wanted, a very relaxed, laid back and family oriented celebration on the mountains of Ale\u2019s childhood. The reception took place in a wooden house in a forest close to the field and it was everything we were hoping for. We didn\u2019t have a planner or any type of professionals involved (except for our photographers) and so everything was made with the help of friends and family and it couldn\u2019t have been better. Italian weddings have a few unique traditions and we wanted to incorporate some of them into our own day. One of them is that the bride doesn\u2019t walk down the aisle with her bouquet and instead the groom holds it and gives it to her when she gets to the top and we included this one in our own wedding day. Another tradition that we enjoyed was the one where the Italian friends prepare several games and pranks for the new wed couple. This was a lot of fun and relatively well behaved!

Hang on, did you just give away the ending? And you\u2019re referencing the writer\u2019s perspective? Are you mad?\n\u201cQuite by chance, a knightly knight by the name of Sir Deus arrived. \u2018Madam,\u201d he said unto her, forcing the words \u2018twixt cup and manly lip, \u2018I am Sir Deus. Deus X Machina. The X stands for, er, Ex. I am here to teach you the art of delusion.'\u201d\nOh, come on! You\u2019re saying that you actually have a character named \u2013\n\u201cFudgemella, startled by the knight\u2019s abrupt\/surprising appearance, laughed with gentle admonishment. \u2018Sir knight, I have no such need for your teaching, for I have already mastered that particular skill.\u2019 She flicked a bead of sweat from her brow with the last two centimetres of a stiffened digit.\nIf I promise not to criticise will you let me leave? Please\u2026no more\u2026\n\u201cThe knight, pushed to a rage beyond compare \u2013 like that other fellow that got just as angry when someone broke his pencil \u2013 charged his mighty steed into the watching diplomats, piercing, quite by happenstance, their hearts with his lance, like a diplomatic kebab. Although that probably shouldn\u2019t be a reference in a period piece. Unless kebabs existed in medieval Poland. Make it a \u2013 what do they have in Poland? Sausages? Yes, pierced their hearts like a mighty polish sausage.\u201d\nNot sure about the imagery in this \u2013 very suspect\u2026\n\u201cThus the dusky maiden\u2019s refusal to bow down to masculine domination caused the world to explode into war that lasted eight years, with a hiatus in the middle when one of the knight\u2019s friends got lost in a copse. The End.\u201d\nSo\u2026a sexist morality nonsense tale? Didn\u2019t know what to write for a blog post, eh?\n\u201cCan you tell?\u201d\n"}
